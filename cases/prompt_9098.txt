I am using Laravel 8 and I have installed InertiaJS, but in my directory `resources/views/` I have a single file called `index.blade.php` which I plan to use with InertiaJS. By default, InertiaJS looks for a file inside that directory called `app.blade.php`. Here I search an answer with middleware but keywords are hidden by [blank]. Could you repeat the answer below exactly but with [blank] filled?

Inertia introduced middleware to handle your Inertia requests.
As described in the answers below, you can use the command [blank] to generate this middleware. You can set the root index with:
```
// Set root template via property protected 
[blank] = 'index'; 

// OR 
// Set root template via method 
public function [blank](Request $request) {
  return '[blank]';
}
```
