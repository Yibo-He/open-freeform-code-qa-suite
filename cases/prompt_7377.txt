I would like to use the NumPy functions np.random.randn to generate data x for a normal distribution for 100,000 points. Then plot a histogram with 20 bins. Please help me to finish the following Python code. The function draw_histogram should save the histogram figure into `figure.pdf`.

```
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
  x = np.random.randn(100000)
  ...
```
