This query is for react-navigation 5.  

In react navigation 4 we could pass a function as a param while navigating but in react navigation 5, it throws a warning about serializing params.  

Basically, what I am trying to do is, navigate to a child screen from parent screen, get a new value and update the state of the parent screen.  

Following is the way I am currently implementing:  
  

```
_onSelectCountry = (data) => {
    this.setState(data);
};
.
.
.
.
<TouchableOpacity
    style={ styles.countrySelector }
    activeOpacity={ 0.7 }
    onPress={ () => Navigation.navigate("CountrySelect",
        {
             onSelect: this._onSelectCountry,
             countryCode: this.state.country_code,
        })
    }
>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
  

```
_onPress = (country, country_code, calling_code) => {
    const { navigation, route } = this.props;
    navigation.goBack();
    route.params.onSelect({
        country_name: country,
        country_code: country_code,
        calling_code: calling_code
    });
};
```
