I have a list called `fileList` containing thousands of filenames and sizes like this:

```
['/home/rob/Pictures/some/folder/picture one something.jpg', '143452']
['/home/rob/Pictures/some/other/folder/pictureBlah.jpg', '473642']
['/home/rob/Pictures/folder/blahblahpicture filename.jpg', '345345']
```

I want to copy the files using item[0] for each item in `fileList` as the source but to another folder destination. I use
```
for item in fileList:
    copyfile(item[0], "/Users/username/Desktop/testPhotos")
```

but get an error

```
IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/Users/username/Desktop/testPhotos'
```

Could you complete the function `copy_from_file_list` below to finish the task?

```
from shutil import copyfile

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
```
