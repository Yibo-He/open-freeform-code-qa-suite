The following error occur when I tried to Generate Signed Bundle. Note: Error occurs after I updated my android studio 3.6.3 to version 4.0 and Gradle build to 6.1.1.
What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:signReleaseBundle'.

> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.Workers$ActionFacade
