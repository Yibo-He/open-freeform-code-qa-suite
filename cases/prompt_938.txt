I want to import an image in Typescript. Here is the `main.ts` file: 

```
import * as Logo from 'assets/images/logo.png';
```

HTML file `main.html`:

```
<img src={Logo} alt="" />
```


The type definition in `d.ts` file is:

```
declare module "*.png" {
  const value: string;
  export default value;
}
```

I get the error: 
```
[ts] Types of property 'src' are incompatible. Type 'typeof import("*.png")' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'. Type 'typeof import("*.png")' is not assignable to type 'string'. 
```

Please answer in the following format: I should modity [name] file to ```[code]```
