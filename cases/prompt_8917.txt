I am developing an Android app with Kotlin, and I would like to use getSize() method to get the screen height. However, with API level above 30 the method getSize() is declared deprecaed. What can be used instead of getSize() for obtain screen heights? Could you help me finish the following functon?

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val windowInsets: WindowInsets = windowMetrics.windowInsets

    val insets = windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.navigationBars() or WindowInsets.Type.displayCutout())
    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom

    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val orig_height = b.height()
