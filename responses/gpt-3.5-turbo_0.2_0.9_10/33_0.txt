The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` suggests that the `location_web` plugin is missing or not properly configured in your project. 

To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `settings.gradle` file in your project and add the following line:

   ```
   include ':location_web'
   ```

2. Save the file and then run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the missing plugin.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try deleting the `location` package from your `pubspec.yaml` file and then reinstalling it by running `flutter pub get`.

Regarding the second error message `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems like you are trying to display a `Future` object as an image. To fix this error, you can use a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously build your UI based on the result of the `_getUserLocation()` function. Here's an example:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code uses a `FutureBuilder` widget to display a loading spinner while `_getUserLocation()` is running, and then displays the image once the future completes successfully.
