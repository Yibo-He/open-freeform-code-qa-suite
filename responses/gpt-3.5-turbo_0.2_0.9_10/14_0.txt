To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub Pages, you can use the `nuxt generate` command to generate a static version of your website and then push the generated files to a GitHub repository.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and create a new repository for your website.

2. Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

3. Add the following configuration to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

   ```
   export default {
     // ...
     generate: {
       dir: 'docs'
     },
     // ...
   }
   ```

   This will generate your static website in a `docs` directory instead of the default `dist` directory.

4. Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

   ```
   "scripts": {
     // ...
     "deploy": "npm run generate && gh-pages -d docs"
   }
   ```

   This will run the `nuxt generate` command to generate your static website and then use the `gh-pages` package to push the generated files to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

5. Run the following command to deploy your website:

   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This will generate your static website and push the generated files to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

6. Finally, go to your GitHub repository settings and set the GitHub Pages source to the `gh-pages` branch.

   Your website should now be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
