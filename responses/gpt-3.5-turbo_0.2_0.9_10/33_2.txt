The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` indicates that the `location_web` plugin is not installed or configured properly in your project. To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `settings.gradle` file in your project and add the following line:

   ```
   include ':location_web'
   ```

2. Save the file and then run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This will download and install any missing dependencies, including the `location_web` plugin.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```
   location_web: ^2.0.0
   ```

   This will explicitly add the `location_web` plugin to your project and ensure that it is installed and configured properly.

Regarding the second error message `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems that you are trying to display an image using a `Future` object instead of a `String` URL. To fix this, you can use a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously load the image URL and display it once it is available. Here's an example:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `FutureBuilder` widget takes a `Future<String>` object as its `future` parameter and asynchronously loads the image URL. Once the URL is available, it displays the image using the `Image.network` widget. If the URL is not available yet, it displays a `CircularProgressIndicator` widget instead.
