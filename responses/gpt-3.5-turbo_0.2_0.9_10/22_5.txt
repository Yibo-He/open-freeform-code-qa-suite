The issue is with the way you are passing the `booksRefresh` function to the `AddBookForm` component. You are passing it as a prop, but you are not destructuring it properly in the component definition. 

To fix this, you need to destructure the `booksRefresh` function from the props object in the component definition. Here's the corrected code:

```
const AddBookForm = ({booksRefresh}) => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const [description, setDescription] = useState();
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const postRequestHandler = () => {
        addBook(title, description);
        booksRefresh();
    }
...
 return (
        ...
            <Button type="submit" onClick={postRequestHandler} variant="outline-success">Add</Button>
        </div>
    )
```

Notice the use of curly braces around `booksRefresh` in the function definition. This is called destructuring and it allows you to extract the `booksRefresh` function from the props object.
