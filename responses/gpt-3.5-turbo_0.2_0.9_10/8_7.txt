Sure! Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  var newDate = new Date(date.getTime() + date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
  newDate.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return newDate;
}
```

Here's how it works:

1. We start by creating a new `Date` object based on the input `date` object. We add the timezone offset to the time to get the UTC time.
2. We then set the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds of the new `Date` object to 0, effectively setting it to midnight UTC.
3. Finally, we return the new `Date` object.

Note that this function assumes that you want to convert the date to midnight UTC. If you want to convert it to a different time of day, you'll need to adjust the `setUTCHours` call accordingly.
