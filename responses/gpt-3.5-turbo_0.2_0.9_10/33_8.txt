The first error message suggests that the `location_web` plugin is missing. You can try adding it to your `pubspec.yaml` file and running `flutter pub get` to install it. Here's an example of how to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```
dependencies:
  location: ^4.1.1
  location_web: ^0.1.0+2
```

As for the second error message, it seems like you're trying to display a `Future` object as an image. You need to wait for the `Future` to complete and return the URL before you can display the image. One way to do this is to use a `FutureBuilder` widget. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Text("${snapshot.error}");
        }
        return CircularProgressIndicator();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code will display a loading spinner while the `Future` is being fetched, and then display the image once the `Future` completes.
