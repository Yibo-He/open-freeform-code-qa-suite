The exception message suggests that you are missing the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency. Although you have mentioned that you have already added the dependency, it seems like it is not being picked up by your project.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the dependency is present in your project's classpath. You can do this by running the following command in your project's root directory:
```
mvn dependency:tree
```
This will show you the complete dependency tree of your project. Look for the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency and make sure it is present.

2. Try adding the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency explicitly in your `pom.xml` file:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

3. Make sure that your `UserRegistrationApplication` class is in the root package of your project. If it is not, you may need to add the `@ComponentScan` annotation to your `UserRegistrationApplication` class to specify the base package(s) to scan for components:
```
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"test.user"})
```

4. If none of the above solutions work, try cleaning your project and rebuilding it:
```
mvn clean install
```

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue.
