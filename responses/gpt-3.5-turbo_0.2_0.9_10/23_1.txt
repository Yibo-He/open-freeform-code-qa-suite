The error message indicates that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch a browser process. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but one common cause is that the necessary dependencies are not installed on your system.

To fix this, you can try installing the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install -y libgbm-dev
```

If that doesn't work, you can also try installing the Chromium browser manually by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser
```

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, try running your code again and see if the error persists.
