You can clone a repository using a personal access token by running the following command:

```
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```

To commit and push changes using a personal access token, you can use the following commands:

```
cd /path/to/repository
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Make sure to replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your own information.
