There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14, as it ultimately depends on the coding style and conventions of your team or organization. However, it is recommended to be consistent within your codebase and choose one naming convention for getters and setters. If you choose to use records, it may be a good idea to stick with the default naming convention of using the field name as the getter method name. If you choose to stick with the Java bean convention, you can continue to use `getName()` for consistency.
