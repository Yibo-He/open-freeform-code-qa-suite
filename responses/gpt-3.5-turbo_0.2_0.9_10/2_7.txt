Yes, you can use the Matplotlib inline backend to display the plots directly in the Visual Studio Code editor. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

The `%matplotlib inline` command tells Matplotlib to display the plots inline in the output cell of the Jupyter notebook or in the Visual Studio Code editor.

Note that you need to have the Matplotlib library installed in your Python environment for this to work. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install matplotlib
```
