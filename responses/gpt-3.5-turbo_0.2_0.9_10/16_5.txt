To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Once installed, you can generate a REST client by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-your-swagger-spec-file> -l <language-of-your-choice> -o <output-directory>
```

For example, if your Swagger spec file is located at `/path/to/your/swagger.yaml`, and you want to generate a Java client in the directory `/path/to/output`, you can run the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i /path/to/your/swagger.yaml -l java -o /path/to/output
```

3. After running the command, Swagger codegen will generate the REST client in the specified output directory. You can then use the generated client to interact with your REST server.

Note that you need to have a valid Swagger spec file that describes your REST server's API in order to generate a REST client using Swagger codegen.
