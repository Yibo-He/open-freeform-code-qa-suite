It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Make sure that the libraries you are using in your project are installed correctly and are up to date. You can check this by running `pod install` or `pod update` in your project directory.

2. Check the library search paths: Go to your project's Build Settings and check the Library Search Paths. Make sure that the paths to the libraries are correct and that they are included in the search paths.

3. Check the Frameworks and Libraries: Go to your project's Build Phases and check the Frameworks and Libraries section. Make sure that the required libraries are added here.

4. Check the Build Settings: Go to your project's Build Settings and check the Other Linker Flags. Make sure that the flags are set correctly and that they are not conflicting with each other.

5. Clean and Build: Try cleaning your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode and then build it again by going to Product > Build. 

6. Check the target: Make sure that you have selected the correct target for your project.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try creating a new Xcode project and adding the required libraries again.
