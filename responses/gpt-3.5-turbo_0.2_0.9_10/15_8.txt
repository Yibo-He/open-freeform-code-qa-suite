Yes, you can use the `FigureCanvasAgg` class from `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` to render the `Figure` to a `numpy` array, and then use `PIL.Image.fromarray` to create a `PIL.Image` object. Here's the completed code:

```
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: Figure) -> Image:
    canvas = FigureCanvasAgg(input)
    canvas.draw()
    buf = canvas.buffer_rgba()
    width, height = input.get_size_inches() * input.dpi
    return Image.frombytes('RGBA', (int(width), int(height)), buf, 'raw', 'RGBA')
```

Note that we're using `FigureCanvasAgg` to render the `Figure` to a `numpy` array in RGBA format, and then using `PIL.Image.frombytes` to create a `PIL.Image` object from the array. We also need to calculate the size of the image in pixels based on the size of the `Figure` in inches and its DPI.
