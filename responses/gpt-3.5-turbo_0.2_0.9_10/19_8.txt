This error occurs when the number of files that are being watched by the system exceeds the limit set by the operating system. 

To fix this issue, you can try increasing the maximum number of files that can be watched by the system. 

On macOS or Linux, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

This will increase the limit to 524288. You can try increasing it further if needed.

On Windows, you can try running the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

If this doesn't work, you can try closing some of the open files or restarting your computer to release the file handles.
