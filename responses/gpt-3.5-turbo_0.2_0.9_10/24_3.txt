There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. However, it is recommended to follow the convention of using the same name as the field for records, and using the "get" prefix for traditional Java beans. 

If you have a mix of records and traditional Java beans in your codebase, it is best to be consistent within each class and use the appropriate naming convention for that class.
