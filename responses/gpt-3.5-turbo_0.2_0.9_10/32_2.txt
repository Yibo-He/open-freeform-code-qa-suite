It seems that the issue is related to the version-platform combination of MongoDB. The requested version-platform combination does not exist, which is causing the 403 error. 

You can try specifying a different version of MongoDB in your `package.json` file. For example, if you are currently using version 4.0.14, you can try downgrading to version 4.0.13 or upgrading to version 4.0.15 to see if that resolves the issue. 

You can also try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again to ensure that all dependencies are up to date. 

If the issue persists, you can try reaching out to the developers of `mongodb-memory-server` for further assistance.
