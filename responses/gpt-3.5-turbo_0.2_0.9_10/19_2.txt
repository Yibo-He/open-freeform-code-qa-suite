This error occurs when the maximum number of files that can be watched by a user is exceeded. You can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the maximum number of files that can be watched by a user by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
   ```

2. If the above solution does not work, you can try increasing the maximum number of files that can be watched by a process by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
   ```

3. If neither of the above solutions work, you can try restarting your computer. This should reset the maximum number of files that can be watched by a user.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you can try upgrading your version of Node.js and/or React Native. Sometimes, this error can occur due to bugs in older versions of these technologies.
