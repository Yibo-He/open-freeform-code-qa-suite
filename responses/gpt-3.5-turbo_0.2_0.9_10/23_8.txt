The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a missing dependency or a compatibility issue with your system.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure you have installed the latest version of Puppeteer and its dependencies. You can do this by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Check if you have installed a compatible version of Chromium or Google Chrome. Puppeteer relies on a specific version of Chromium or Chrome, so make sure you have installed a compatible version. You can do this by running `npm ls puppeteer` in your project directory to see the version of Chromium or Chrome that Puppeteer is using.

3. If you are running Puppeteer on a Linux server, you may need to install additional dependencies. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install libgbm-dev` to install the necessary dependencies.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try launching Puppeteer with the `--no-sandbox` flag. This flag disables the sandbox mode, which can sometimes cause issues. You can do this by adding the following line to your code before launching Puppeteer:

   ```
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox'] });
   ```

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue and launch the browser process successfully.
