Based on the error message, it seems that the requested version-platform combination does not exist. You can try specifying a different version of MongoDB in your `package.json` file, or try specifying a different platform if you are not running on a standard platform. 

For example, you can try adding the following to your `package.json` file:

```
"mongodb-memory-server": {
    "version": "latest",
    "platform": "win32"
}
```

This will ensure that the latest version of mongodb-memory-server is used, and that it is downloaded for the win32 platform. You can replace "win32" with your platform if you are not running on Windows.
