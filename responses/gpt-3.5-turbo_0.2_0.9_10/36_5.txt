The exception message suggests that you are missing the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency. This is because Feign uses Ribbon for client-side load balancing by default. 

You mentioned that you have already tried adding the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency to your `pom.xml`, but it didn't help. In that case, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency is added to the correct module in your project. If you have a multi-module project, make sure that the dependency is added to the module that contains the Feign client interface.

2. Try excluding the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency from the `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign` dependency, and add it separately to your `pom.xml`. Here's an example:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

3. If none of the above solutions work, try upgrading your Spring Boot version to the latest stable release. There might be some compatibility issues with the version you are currently using.
