You can try the following modified code to install and import the `ujson` module in Google Colab:

```
!pip install ujson
import ujson
```

This should install the `ujson` module and import it successfully. Note that you don't need to install Miniconda in Colab as it already comes with pre-installed packages and you can install additional packages using `pip`.
