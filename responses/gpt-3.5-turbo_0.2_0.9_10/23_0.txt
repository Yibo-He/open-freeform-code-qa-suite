The error message suggests that Puppeteer is unable to launch a browser instance. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure you have installed Puppeteer by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chrome/Chromium is not installed: Puppeteer relies on Chrome or Chromium to launch a browser instance. Make sure you have installed one of these browsers on your system.

3. Chrome/Chromium is not in the default location: If you have installed Chrome or Chromium in a non-default location, you need to specify the path to the executable when launching Puppeteer. You can do this by passing an object with the `executablePath` property to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

4. Permissions issue: If you are running the code on a server or in a restricted environment, you may not have the necessary permissions to launch a browser instance. In this case, you may need to contact your system administrator or use a different hosting environment.

Try checking these possible causes and see if any of them apply to your situation.
