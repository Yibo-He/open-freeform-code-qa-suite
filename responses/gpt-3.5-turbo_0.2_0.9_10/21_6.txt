Yes, you can try the following modified code to install and import the `ujson` module in Google Colab:

```
!pip install ujson aiohttp tqdm
import ujson
```

This code will use `pip` instead of `conda` to install the required packages. Also, there is no need to set the `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` environment variables or append to `sys.path` as the packages will be installed in the default location accessible by Python.
