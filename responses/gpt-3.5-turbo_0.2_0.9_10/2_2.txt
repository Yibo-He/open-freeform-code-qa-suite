Yes, you can use the built-in Jupyter Notebook support in Visual Studio Code to display the plot inline. Here's how you can modify your code to do that:

```
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Note the addition of the `%matplotlib inline` magic command at the beginning of the code. This tells matplotlib to display the plots inline in the output cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

Also note the addition of the `#%%` cell separator. This is required by the Jupyter Notebook format, and tells Visual Studio Code to treat the code block as a separate cell.

With these changes, you should be able to run the code and see the plot displayed inline in the output cell of the Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code.
