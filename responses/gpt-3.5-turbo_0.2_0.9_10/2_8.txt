Yes, you can use the built-in Jupyter Notebook integration in Visual Studio Code to display the plot inline. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Note the addition of the `%matplotlib inline` magic command at the beginning of the code. This command tells Matplotlib to display the plots inline in the output cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

Also, note the addition of the `#%%` comment before the import statement. This is a cell separator that tells Visual Studio Code to treat the code below it as a separate cell.

When you run this code in Visual Studio Code, you should see the plot displayed inline in the output cell below the code cell.
