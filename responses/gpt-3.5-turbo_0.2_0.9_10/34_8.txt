You can use the `valueChanges` method of the `FormControl` to detect changes in the radio group selection. Then, you can use `ngIf` directive to show or hide the div based on the selected value. Here's how you can modify the div:

```
<div id='divabc' *ngIf="myform.get('Schedule').value === 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

Make sure to replace `'abc'` with the actual value of the radio button that should show the div.
