To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to a public hosting like GitHub pages, you can use the following npm command:

```
npm run generate
```

This command will generate a static version of your website in the `dist` directory. You can then push the contents of this directory to your GitHub repository.

To ensure that your website works as a single page application, you will need to configure your router to use the `history` mode. You can do this by adding the following code to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  router: {
    mode: 'history'
  }
}
```

This will ensure that your website uses the HTML5 history API for navigation, which is required for a single page application.
