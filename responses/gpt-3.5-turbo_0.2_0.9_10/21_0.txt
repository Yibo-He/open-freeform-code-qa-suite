Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` environment variables are not set correctly. Here's the modified code that should work:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y --prefix /usr/local/ ujson aiohttp tqdm

import sys
import os

# Add the conda libraries to the system path
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/')

# Set the environment variables
os.environ['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/tools/node/bin:/tools/google-cloud-sdk/bin:/opt/bin'
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/'

# Import the ujson module
import ujson
```

Note that I've changed the `PYTHONPATH` to point to the correct version of Python (3.7) and added the conda libraries to the system path. I've also set the `PATH` environment variable to include the necessary directories.
