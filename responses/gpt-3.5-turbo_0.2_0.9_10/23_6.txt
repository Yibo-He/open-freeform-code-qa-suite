The error message suggests that Puppeteer is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed Puppeteer by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chrome is not installed: Puppeteer relies on a version of Chromium to run. Make sure that you have installed Chromium by running `npm install puppeteer-core` in your project directory.

3. Chrome is not in the expected location: Puppeteer expects to find Chromium in a specific location. If you have installed Chromium manually, make sure that it is installed in the expected location. Alternatively, you can specify the location of Chromium when launching Puppeteer by passing the `executablePath` option to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

4. Permissions issue: Puppeteer may not have the necessary permissions to launch the browser process. Make sure that the user running the code has the necessary permissions to launch Chromium.

5. ABI compatibility issue: The error message `checked failed crashForExceptionInNonABIComplianceCodeRange` suggests that there may be an ABI compatibility issue between Puppeteer and Chromium. Try updating Puppeteer to the latest version by running `npm update puppeteer` in your project directory.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to provide more information about your environment and the specific error message you are seeing.
