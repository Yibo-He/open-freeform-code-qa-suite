It seems like the issue is related to SSL protocol error. You can try accessing the app using `http` instead of `https` by typing `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. If this works, then it means that the SSL certificate is not configured properly.

If you want to access the app using `https`, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the SSL certificate is configured properly in your application. You can check this by looking at the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file in your project.

2. If the SSL certificate is configured properly, then you can try importing the SSL certificate into your browser. To do this, you can follow the steps mentioned in this article: https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-import-a-certificate-into-google-chrome.html

3. If importing the SSL certificate does not work, then you can try running the app on a different port by changing the `server.port` property in the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file. For example, you can change it to `server.port=8081`.

4. If none of the above steps work, then you can try disabling SSL in your application by setting the `server.ssl.enabled` property to `false` in the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file. However, this is not recommended for production environments.

Regarding your question about Apache, it is not necessary to install Apache to access your app in localhost. The app should be accessible by typing `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
