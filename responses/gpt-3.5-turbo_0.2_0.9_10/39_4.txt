It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few more things you can try:

1. Check if the library directories exist: Go to the directory `/Users/kh/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/om-euxqzibzllbcmndwqrgthdeotiro/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/` and see if the directories for `AFNetworking`, `JSONModel`, `ReactiveCocoa`, `Realm`, `SAMKeychain`, and `Sentry` exist. If they don't, then try cleaning the project and rebuilding it.

2. Check if the library files exist: If the directories exist, then check if the library files (`libAFNetworking.a`, `libJSONModel.a`, etc.) are present in those directories. If they are not, then try reinstalling the libraries using CocoaPods.

3. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and check if the Library Search Paths are correct. They should point to the directories where the library files are located. If they are not, then update the paths accordingly.

4. Check if the library targets are correct: Go to your project's Build Phases and check if the libraries are added to the Link Binary With Libraries section. If they are not, then add them.

5. Check if the library versions are compatible: Make sure that the versions of the libraries you are using are compatible with each other and with your project's deployment target.

If none of these solutions work, then try creating a new Xcode project and adding the required libraries again.
