To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub Pages, you can use the `nuxt generate` command to generate the static files and then push them to a GitHub repository. Here are the steps:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and a repository set up for your website.
2. Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency by running `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`.
3. In your `nuxt.config.js` file, add the following configuration:

```
export default {
  // ...
  generate: {
    dir: 'docs'
  },
  router: {
    base: '/<your-repo-name>/'
  }
}
```

This tells Nuxt.js to generate the static files in a `docs` directory and sets the base URL for the router to your repository name.

4. In your `package.json` file, add the following scripts:

```
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "npm run generate && gh-pages -d docs"
}
```

This script will run the `nuxt generate` command and then deploy the generated files to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package.

5. Run the `npm run deploy` command to deploy your website to GitHub Pages.

Note that if your website has dynamic content that depends on user input, you will need to use client-side rendering instead of static generation. In this case, you can deploy your website as a single-page application by setting the `mode` option to `'spa'` in your `nuxt.config.js` file and following the same deployment steps.
