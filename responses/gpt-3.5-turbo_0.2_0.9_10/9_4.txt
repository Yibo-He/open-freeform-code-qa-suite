Yes, you can customize the height of `BottomNavigationBar` in Flutter by wrapping it inside a `SizedBox` widget and setting the desired height. Here's an example:

```dart
Scaffold(
  bottomNavigationBar: SizedBox(
    height: 50, // set the desired height here
    child: BottomNavigationBar(
      // add your tabs here
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `BottomNavigationBar` is wrapped inside a `SizedBox` with a height of 50, but you can adjust the height to your liking.
