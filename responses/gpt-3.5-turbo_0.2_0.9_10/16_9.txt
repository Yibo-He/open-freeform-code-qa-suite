To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Once installed, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to generate the client.

3. Run the following command to generate the client:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-swagger-spec> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-swagger-spec>` with the path to your Swagger specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client in (e.g. java, python, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to generate the client.

For example, if your Swagger specification file is located at `/path/to/swagger.yaml`, you want to generate a Java client, and you want to output the client to the directory `/path/to/client`, you would run the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i /path/to/swagger.yaml -l java -o /path/to/client
```

4. Once the client is generated, you can import it into your project and use it to make REST API calls to your server.

Note: Make sure that your Swagger specification file is valid and up-to-date before generating the client.
