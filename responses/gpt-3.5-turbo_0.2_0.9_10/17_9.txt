To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to add the alias to your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

In this example, we're adding an alias called `@styles` that points to the `src/styled` directory. 

After adding this configuration, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and have IntelliSense work properly. For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

When you hover over `@styles/Button` in VSCode, it should show you the path to the module and allow you to click on it to open the file.
