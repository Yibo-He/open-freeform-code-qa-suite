This error occurs when there are too many files being watched by the system. You can try increasing the number of files that can be watched by the system by running the following command in your terminal:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

This will increase the number of files that can be watched by the system to 524288. If this doesn't work, you can try increasing the number even further.
