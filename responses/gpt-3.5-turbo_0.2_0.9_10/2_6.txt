Yes, you can use the built-in Jupyter Notebook integration in Visual Studio Code to display the plots directly in the editor. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

1. Install the `ipykernel` package by running the following command in your terminal: 

   ```
   pip install ipykernel
   ```

2. Open your Python file in Visual Studio Code.

3. Click on the "Python Interactive" button in the bottom left corner of the editor.

4. This will open a new tab with a Jupyter Notebook interface. Click on the "+" button to create a new notebook cell.

5. Copy and paste your code into the new cell.

6. Add the following line at the beginning of the cell to enable inline plotting:

   ```
   %matplotlib inline
   ```

7. Run the cell by clicking on the "Run Cell" button or by pressing "Shift + Enter".

8. The plot should now be displayed directly in the editor.

Here's the modified code:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```
