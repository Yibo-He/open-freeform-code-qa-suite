Sure! Here's the code to split the dataset into training and validation sets:

```
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, SubsetRandomSampler

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Split dataset into training and validation sets
dataset_size = len(dataset)
indices = list(range(dataset_size))
split = int(np.floor(0.2 * dataset_size))
np.random.shuffle(indices)
train_indices, val_indices = indices[split:], indices[:split]

# Create data samplers for training and validation sets
train_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(train_indices)
val_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(val_indices)

# Create data loaders for training and validation sets
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, sampler=train_sampler)
validation_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, sampler=val_sampler)
```

This code uses `SubsetRandomSampler` to split the dataset into training and validation sets without overlap. The `train_indices` and `val_indices` lists are created by randomly shuffling the indices of the dataset and then splitting them based on the desired split ratio (80/20 in this case). Finally, `DataLoader` is used to create data loaders for the training and validation sets using the respective samplers.
