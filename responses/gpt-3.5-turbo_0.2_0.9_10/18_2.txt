This error occurs when the Go language server is unable to find the package data for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package. This can happen if the package is not installed or if the Go language server is not able to find it in the correct location.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package is installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. If the package is already installed, try running the following command to clean the Go module cache:

   ```
   go clean -modcache
   ```

3. Restart VSCode and try importing the package again. The error should be resolved and you should be able to use intellisense suggestions.

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating the Go language server by running the following command:

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls
```

This should update the Go language server to the latest version and may resolve the issue.
