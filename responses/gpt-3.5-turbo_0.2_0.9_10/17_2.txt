To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to configure the `paths` property in your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/node_modules/*"]
}
```

In this example, we set the `baseUrl` to the root directory of our project. Then, we define a `paths` object with the key `"@styles/*"`, which maps to the value `["src/styled/*"]`. This tells VSCode to look for any imports that start with `@styles/` and replace it with `src/styled/`.

After configuring this, you should be able to import your styles module like this:

```js
import styles from '@styles/index';
```

And when you hover over `@styles/index` in VSCode, it should show the correct path and allow you to click on it to open the file.
