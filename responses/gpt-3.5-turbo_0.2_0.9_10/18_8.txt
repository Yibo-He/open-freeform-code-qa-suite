This error occurs because VSCode is unable to locate the package data for the Redigo package. To solve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the Redigo package is installed in your GoPath. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if the package is installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```
   go list -f '{{.ImportPath}} {{.Error}}' github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   This should output the package import path and any errors that occurred during installation.

3. If the package is installed correctly, try restarting VSCode and see if the error persists.

4. If the error still persists, try adding the following line to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

   ```
   "gopls": {"experimentalWorkspaceModule": true}
   ```

   This will enable the experimental workspace module feature in the Go language server, which can help with package imports.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try manually adding the package path to your `go.mod` file:

   ```
   require github.com/gomodule/redigo v1.8.0
   replace github.com/gomodule/redigo => github.com/gomodule/redigo v1.8.0
   ```

   Replace `v1.8.0` with the version of Redigo that you have installed.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the package import error in VSCode.
