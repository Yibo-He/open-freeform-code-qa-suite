In react-navigation 5, passing functions as params is not recommended as it can cause issues with serialization. Instead, you can use the `useCallback` hook to create a memoized function that can be passed as a param.

Here's an example of how you can update your code to use `useCallback`:

```
import { useCallback } from 'react';

// ...

const onSelectCountry = useCallback((data) => {
  this.setState(data);
}, []);

// ...

<TouchableOpacity
  style={ styles.countrySelector }
  activeOpacity={ 0.7 }
  onPress={ () => Navigation.navigate("CountrySelect", {
    onSelect: onSelectCountry,
    countryCode: this.state.country_code,
  })}
>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

And in the child screen:

```
const onPress = (country, country_code, calling_code) => {
  const { navigation, route } = this.props;
  navigation.goBack();
  route.params.onSelect({
    country_name: country,
    country_code: country_code,
    calling_code: calling_code
  });
};
```

By using `useCallback`, the function `onSelectCountry` is memoized and will not be recreated on every render. This ensures that the function reference remains the same and can be safely passed as a param without causing serialization issues.
