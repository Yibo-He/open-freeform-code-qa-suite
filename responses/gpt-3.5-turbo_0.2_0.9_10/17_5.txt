To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias like `@styles`, you need to add the alias to your `jsconfig.json` file. Here's an example of how to do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["./src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

In this example, we added a `paths` property to the `compilerOptions` object, which maps the `@styles/*` alias to the `./src/styled/*` path. 

Now, when you import a module using the `@styles` alias, VSCode should be able to IntelliSense the module path and allow you to access it by clicking on it. 

For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

Note that you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.
