The error message suggests that the requested version-platform combination does not exist. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The version of mongodb-memory-server you are using is outdated and does not support the requested version-platform combination.
2. The version-platform combination you are requesting is not supported by MongoDB.
3. There is an issue with the download link for the MongoDB binary.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check if there is a newer version of mongodb-memory-server available and update your package.json file accordingly.
2. Check if the version-platform combination you are requesting is supported by MongoDB.
3. Try manually downloading the MongoDB binary from the download link provided in the error message and see if it works. If it does, then there may be an issue with the download link used by mongodb-memory-server.
