You can use the `plt.hist()` function from Matplotlib to plot the histogram. Here's the complete code:

```
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
    x = np.random.randn(100000)
    plt.hist(x, bins=20)
    plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

draw_histogram()
```

In this code, we generate 100,000 random numbers from a normal distribution using `np.random.randn()`. Then, we use `plt.hist()` to plot a histogram with 20 bins. Finally, we save the figure using `plt.savefig()`.
