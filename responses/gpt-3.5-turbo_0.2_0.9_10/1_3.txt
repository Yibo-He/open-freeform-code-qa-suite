Here's the code for the `getCurrentDate` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function getCurrentDate() {
  const today = new Date();
  const month = today.getMonth() + 1;
  const day = today.getDate();
  const year = today.getFullYear();
  return `${month}/${day}/${year}`;
}
```

This function creates a new `Date` object with the current date and time, then extracts the month, day, and year components from it. It then returns a string in the format `MM/DD/YYYY`. Note that we add 1 to the month value, since `getMonth()` returns a zero-based index (i.e. January is 0, February is 1, etc.).
