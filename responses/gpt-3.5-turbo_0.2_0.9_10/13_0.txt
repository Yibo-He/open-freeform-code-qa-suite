`List` is a view that displays a scrollable list of data whereas `ForEach` is a view that iterates over a collection of data and displays a view for each element in the collection. 

In other words, `List` is a higher-level view that provides additional functionality such as scrolling and selection, while `ForEach` is a lower-level view that simply iterates over a collection and displays a view for each element. 

You can use `ForEach` to create a custom list view, or you can use `List` to display a list of data with default styling and functionality.
