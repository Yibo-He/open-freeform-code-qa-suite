You can use the `ngIf` directive to conditionally show or hide the `div` based on the selected value of the radio group. Here's how you can modify the `div`:

```
<div id='divabc' *ngIf="myform.get('Schedule').value === 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

This will only show the `div` if the selected value of the radio group is "abc".
