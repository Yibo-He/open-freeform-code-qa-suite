This error usually occurs when the Go extension for VSCode is unable to find the package in the Go workspace. Here are a few steps you can try to solve this issue:

1. Make sure that the Redigo package is installed in your Go workspace. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if your Go workspace is set up correctly. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go env
   ```

   This command will display the environment variables related to your Go workspace. Make sure that the `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` variables are set up correctly.

3. If the above steps do not work, try restarting VSCode and rebuilding your Go workspace. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go build ./...
   ```

   This command will rebuild all the packages in your Go workspace.

If none of the above steps work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the Redigo package. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
go clean -i github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
```

This will uninstall and reinstall the Redigo package in your Go workspace.
