You can use the `plt.hist()` function to plot the histogram with 20 bins. Here's the complete code:

```
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
  x = np.random.randn(100000)
  plt.hist(x, bins=20)
  plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

draw_histogram()
```

This code generates 100,000 random numbers from a normal distribution using `np.random.randn()`. Then, it plots a histogram of the data using `plt.hist()`, with 20 bins specified by the `bins` parameter. Finally, it saves the figure as a PDF using `plt.savefig()`.
