To get the screen height in Android with API level above 30, you can use the following code:

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val insets = windowMetrics.windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.systemBars())

    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom
    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val height = b.height() - insetsHeight

    return height
}
```

In this code, we use the `WindowMetrics` class to get the height of the screen. We also use the `WindowInsets` class to get the height of the system bars (such as the status bar and navigation bar) and subtract it from the total height of the screen to get the usable height.

Note that we use the `WindowInsets.Type.systemBars()` flag instead of `WindowInsets.Type.navigationBars() or WindowInsets.Type.displayCutout()` because the former includes all system bars, including the navigation bar and cutout (if present).
