Yes, you can use the `FigureCanvasAgg` class from `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` to render the `Figure` to a `numpy` array, and then use the `Image.fromarray()` method from `PIL` to create the `PIL.Image`. Here's the completed code:

```
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: Figure) -> Image:
    canvas = FigureCanvasAgg(input)
    canvas.draw()
    width, height = input.get_size_inches() * input.get_dpi()
    image = Image.frombytes('RGB', (int(width), int(height)), canvas.tostring_rgb())
    return image
```

Note that we use `FigureCanvasAgg` to render the `Figure` to a `numpy` array, and then use `Image.frombytes()` to create the `PIL.Image`. We also get the size of the `Figure` in inches and multiply it by the DPI to get the size of the `numpy` array. Finally, we return the `PIL.Image`.
