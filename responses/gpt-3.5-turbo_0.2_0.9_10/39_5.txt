It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are some additional solutions you can try:

1. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and search for "Library Search Paths". Make sure that the paths to the required libraries are correct and exist in your project directory.

2. Check if the libraries are added to your project: Go to your project's Build Phases and search for "Link Binary With Libraries". Make sure that the required libraries are added to your project. If they are not added, click on the "+" button and add them.

3. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Try reinstalling the required libraries using CocoaPods. First, remove the libraries from your Podfile and run `pod install` to remove them from your project. Then, add the libraries back to your Podfile and run `pod install` again to install them.

4. Check if the libraries are compatible with your Xcode version: Make sure that the required libraries are compatible with your Xcode version. If they are not, try updating your Xcode version or using a different version of the library.

5. Check if there are any conflicts between the libraries: Sometimes, libraries can have conflicts with each other. Try removing one library at a time and see if the error goes away. If it does, then the removed library might be causing the conflict.
