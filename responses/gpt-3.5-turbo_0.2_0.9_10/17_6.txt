To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to add the alias to your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example of how to do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

In this example, we're adding an alias called `@styles` that points to the `src/styled` directory. The `*` at the end of the alias tells VSCode to match any file or directory within the `src/styled` directory.

After adding this configuration to your `jsconfig.json` file, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and have IntelliSense work properly. For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

When you hover over `@styles/Button` in VSCode, you should see a tooltip that shows the full path to the `Button` module. And when you click on it, VSCode should take you directly to the `Button` module.
