You should modify the `main.ts` file to:

```
import Logo from 'assets/images/logo.png';
```

And modify the HTML file `main.html` to:

```
<img src={Logo.default} alt="" />
```

This is because the `import` statement in `main.ts` is importing the entire module as an object, not just the value of the module. By using `import Logo from 'assets/images/logo.png'`, you are importing the default export of the module, which is the value of the module. 

In the HTML file, you need to access the value of the module by using `Logo.default`.
