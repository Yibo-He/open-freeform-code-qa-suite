To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to add the alias to your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example of how to do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["./src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

In this example, we added an alias `@styles` that points to the `./src/styled` directory. Now you can use the alias in your import statements like this:

```javascript
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

VSCode should now be able to IntelliSense the module path and you can access it by clicking on it.
