This error message usually occurs when the Go module cache is corrupted or outdated. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the command `go clean -modcache` to clean the Go module cache.
3. Run the command `go mod tidy` to update the Go module dependencies.
4. Restart VSCode and try importing the package again.

If the issue persists, you can try updating the Redigo package to the latest version by running the command `go get -u github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis`. This will update the package to the latest version and also update the Go module cache.

If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files from your project directory and running `go mod init` to recreate them. This will create a new Go module and update the dependencies.
