This error occurs when the Go language server is unable to find the package data for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package. This can happen if the package is not installed or if the Go language server is not able to locate it.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the `redigo` package is installed. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. If the package is already installed, try restarting the Go language server. You can do this by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and running the "Go: Restart Language Server" command.

3. If restarting the language server doesn't work, try adding the following line to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

   ```
   "gopls": {
       "experimentalWorkspaceModule": true
   }
   ```

   This will enable experimental support for Go modules in the language server, which may help resolve the issue.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try manually adding the package path to your `go.mod` file. To do this, open your `go.mod` file and add the following line:

   ```
   require github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis v1.8.0
   ```

   This will tell Go to use version 1.8.0 of the `redigo` package. You can replace this with the version you are using in your project.

After trying these steps, the error should be resolved and you should be able to use intellisense suggestions for the `redigo` package in VSCode.
