The error message suggests that the requested version-platform combination does not exist. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The version of mongodb-memory-server you are using is outdated and does not support the requested version-platform combination. Try updating to the latest version.

2. There is a temporary issue with the mirror used to download the MongoDB binaries. Try running the tests again later.

3. There is an issue with your network connection that is preventing the download of the MongoDB binaries. Try checking your network connection and firewall settings.

If none of these solutions work, you can try using a different MongoDB testing library such as `mongodb-memory-server-global` or `mongodb-memory-server-for-jest`.
