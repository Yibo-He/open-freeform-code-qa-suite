Yes, there is a way to delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter in a single shot. You can use the `clear()` method of the `SharedPreferences` class to delete all saved preferences.

Here's an example code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

Future<void> clearPreferences() async {
  final SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

You can call the `clearPreferences()` function when the user taps on logout to delete all saved preferences.
