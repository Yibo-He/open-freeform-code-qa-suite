It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are some additional solutions you can try:

1. Check if the library directories exist: 
   - Go to `/Users/kh/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/om-euxqzibzllbcmndwqrgthdeotiro/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/` in Finder and see if the directories for AFNetworking, JSONModel, ReactiveCocoa, Realm, SAMKeychain, and Sentry exist. If not, try rebuilding the project.
   
2. Check if the libraries are included in your project:
   - Go to your project's `Build Phases` and check if the libraries are included in the `Link Binary With Libraries` section. If not, add them by clicking the `+` button and selecting the library.
   
3. Check if the library paths are correct:
   - Go to your project's `Build Settings` and check if the library paths are correct. Make sure they match the directories where the libraries are located. If not, update the paths accordingly.
   
4. Check if the library files are missing:
   - Go to your project's `Pods` directory and check if the library files are present. If not, try running `pod install` again to reinstall the missing libraries.
   
5. Check if the library files are corrupted:
   - Try deleting the library files from your project and reinstalling them using `pod install`.
   
6. Check if the library files are outdated:
   - Try updating the libraries using `pod update`.
   
7. Check if the library files are compatible with your Xcode version:
   - Check the library's documentation to see if it is compatible with your Xcode version. If not, try using a different version of the library that is compatible with your Xcode version.
