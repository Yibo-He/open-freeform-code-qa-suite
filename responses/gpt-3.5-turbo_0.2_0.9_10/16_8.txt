To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to have a Swagger/OpenAPI specification file for your REST server. If you don't have one, you can create it using Swagger Editor or any other tool that supports OpenAPI.

2. Download and install Swagger codegen from the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

3. Once installed, open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to generate the client code.

4. Run the following command to generate the client code:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client code in (e.g. java, python, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to generate the client code.

For example, if your Swagger specification file is located at `C:\myapp\swagger.yaml`, you want to generate the client code in Java, and you want to output the code to `C:\myapp\client`, you would run the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i C:\myapp\swagger.yaml -l java -o C:\myapp\client
```

5. Once the client code is generated, you can import it into your IDE and use it to interact with your REST server.

Note that Swagger codegen supports many programming languages and has many options for customizing the generated code. You can find more information about Swagger codegen in the official documentation: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen
