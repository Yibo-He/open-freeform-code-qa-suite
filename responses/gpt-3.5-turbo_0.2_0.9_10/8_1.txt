Sure! Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  const utcDate = new Date(date.getTime() + date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
  return utcDate;
}
```

This function takes a `Date` object as input and returns a new `Date` object representing the same moment in time, but in UTC timezone.

The `getTimezoneOffset()` method returns the difference in minutes between the local time zone and UTC. We multiply this value by 60 (to convert minutes to seconds) and 1000 (to convert seconds to milliseconds) and add it to the original date's timestamp to get the UTC timestamp.

Hope this helps!
