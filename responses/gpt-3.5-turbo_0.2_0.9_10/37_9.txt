To get the screen height in Android with API level above 30, you can use the following code:

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val insets = windowMetrics.windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.systemBars())

    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom
    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val height = b.height() - insetsHeight

    return height
}
```

In this code, we use the `WindowMetrics` class to obtain the window metrics, and then we use the `WindowInsets` class to obtain the insets of the window. We subtract the insets from the height of the window to obtain the screen height. Note that we use `WindowInsets.Type.systemBars()` to obtain the insets of the system bars, which include the status bar and the navigation bar.
