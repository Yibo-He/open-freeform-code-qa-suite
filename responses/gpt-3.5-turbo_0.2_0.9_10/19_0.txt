This error occurs when the system limit for the number of files that can be watched is reached. You can try increasing the limit by running the following command in your terminal:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

This command will increase the limit to 524288. If the error persists, you can try increasing the limit further by changing the number in the command. 

Alternatively, you can try closing any unnecessary applications or processes that may be using up too many file descriptors.
