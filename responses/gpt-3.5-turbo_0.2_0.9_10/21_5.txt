Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the environment variables are not being set properly. Here's the modified code that should work:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y --prefix /usr/local/ ujson aiohttp tqdm

import sys
import os

# Set the environment variables
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')
os.environ['PATH'] = '/usr/local/miniconda3/bin:' + os.environ['PATH']
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/'

import ujson
```

This code sets the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the correct path and adds the path to the `sys.path` list. It also sets the `PATH` environment variable to include the path to the Anaconda installation. This should allow you to import the `ujson` module successfully.
