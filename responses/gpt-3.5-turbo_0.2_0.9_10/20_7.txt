I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always a good idea to save your work frequently, especially when working with Jupyter Notebook.

Regarding the error message you saw, it's hard to say exactly what it was without more information. However, it's possible that the error message was related to the notebook's kernel. The kernel is the process that runs the code in the notebook, and if there's an error with the kernel, it can cause issues with saving and checkpointing.

As for recovering your work, there are a few things you can try:

1. Check the Jupyter Notebook logs: Jupyter Notebook keeps logs of all the activity in the notebook, including errors and warnings. You can try looking through the logs to see if there's any information about the error you saw. To access the logs, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your notebook is saved. Then run the command `jupyter notebook --debug`. This will start Jupyter Notebook in debug mode and output the logs to the terminal. You can then try to reproduce the error and see if there's any useful information in the logs.

2. Check the Jupyter Notebook autosave directory: Jupyter Notebook saves a copy of your notebook every few minutes to an autosave directory. By default, this directory is located in the same directory as your notebook, with the suffix `.ipynb_checkpoints`. You can try opening the most recent autosave file and see if it contains any of your work.

3. Use a file recovery tool: If the above methods don't work, you can try using a file recovery tool to recover the deleted notebook file. There are many file recovery tools available for MacOS, such as Disk Drill and EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. These tools scan your hard drive for deleted files and attempt to recover them.

I hope one of these methods helps you recover your work. In the future, it's a good idea to save your work frequently and make backups of important files.
