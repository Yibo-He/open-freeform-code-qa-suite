A List is a container view that displays a scrollable list of data, while ForEach is a view that iterates over a collection of data and displays a view for each element in the collection. In other words, List is used to display a list of data, while ForEach is used to create a view for each element in a collection of data. You can use ForEach inside a List to create a dynamic list that can be updated based on changes to the underlying data.
