It seems like the issue is with the version-platform combination of MongoDB. The requested version-platform combination doesn't exist, which is causing the 403 error. 

You can try specifying a different version of MongoDB in the `package.json` file. For example, if you're currently using version 4.0.14, you can try downgrading to version 4.0.13 or upgrading to version 4.0.15 to see if that resolves the issue. 

You can also try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again to ensure that all dependencies are up to date. 

If neither of these solutions work, you can try reaching out to the maintainers of `mongodb-memory-server` for further assistance.
