Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter using the `SharedPreferences` package. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

Future<void> clearPreferences() async {
  final SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

You can call this `clearPreferences()` function when the user taps on logout to delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot.
