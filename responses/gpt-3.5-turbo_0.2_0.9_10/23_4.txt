The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as missing dependencies or incorrect installation.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have installed the latest version of Puppeteer and its dependencies. You can do this by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Check if you have installed the necessary dependencies for running Puppeteer on your system. Puppeteer requires some system-level dependencies to work properly. You can find the list of dependencies for your operating system in the Puppeteer documentation.

3. If you are running Puppeteer on a server, make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies and configured the server properly. For example, you may need to install a headless version of the browser (such as Chromium) on the server.

4. Try running the code with `headless: false` option in the `puppeteer.launch()` method. This will launch the browser in non-headless mode, which can help you diagnose the issue.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try running the code on a different machine or environment to see if the issue persists.
