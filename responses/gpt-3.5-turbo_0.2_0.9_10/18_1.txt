This error occurs when the Go language server cannot find the package data for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package. This can happen if the package is not installed or if the Go language server is not able to locate it.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package is installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. If the package is already installed, try restarting your VSCode editor. This will refresh the Go language server and it should be able to locate the package data.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try adding the following line to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

   ```
   "gopls": {
       "experimentalWorkspaceModule": true
   }
   ```

   This will enable the experimental workspace module feature in the Go language server, which should help it locate the package data.

After trying these steps, the error should be resolved and you should be able to use intellisense suggestions for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package in your Go project.
