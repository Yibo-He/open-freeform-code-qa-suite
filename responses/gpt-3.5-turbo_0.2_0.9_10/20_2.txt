I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always frustrating when that happens. 

Regarding the error message you saw, it's hard to say without more information. However, it's possible that the error message was related to the notebook's kernel. When the kernel encounters an error, it can cause the notebook to stop responding and prevent it from saving properly. 

As for recovering your work, there are a few things you can try:

1. Check the Jupyter Notebook server logs: If you were running Jupyter Notebook on a server, you may be able to find some information in the server logs. Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate what went wrong.

2. Look for temporary files: Jupyter Notebook creates temporary files while you're working on a notebook. These files are usually stored in a hidden folder called `.ipynb_checkpoints`. You mentioned that you tried opening the `filename-checkpoint.ipynb` file within this folder, but it was blank. However, it's possible that there are other temporary files in this folder that might contain some of your work. Look for files with names like `filename-checkpoint-*.ipynb`.

3. Use a file recovery tool: If you're lucky, the data from your lost work might still be on your hard drive. There are many file recovery tools available that can help you recover deleted or lost files. Some popular options include Recuva (for Windows) and Disk Drill (for Mac).

I hope one of these options helps you recover your work. In the future, it's always a good idea to save your work frequently and make backups regularly.
