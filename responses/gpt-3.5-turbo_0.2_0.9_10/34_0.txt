You can use the `valueChanges` event of the `FormControl` to detect changes in the radio group selection and then show/hide the `div` based on the selected value. Here's how you can achieve this:

```
<div [hidden]="myform.controls['Schedule'].value !== 'abc'" id='divabc'>ABC</div>
```

In the above code, we are binding the `hidden` property of the `div` to the expression `myform.controls['Schedule'].value !== 'abc'`. This means that the `div` will be hidden if the value of the `Schedule` radio group is not equal to `'abc'`.

Make sure to replace `myform` with the actual name of your form.
