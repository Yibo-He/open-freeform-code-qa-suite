Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the environment variables and paths are not set correctly. Here's the modified code that should work:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y -c anaconda ujson aiohttp tqdm
import sys
import os
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')
os.environ['PATH'] = '/usr/local/miniconda3/bin:' + os.environ['PATH']
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/'
import ujson
```

The changes made are:

- Added the `-c anaconda` flag to the `conda install` command to specify the Anaconda channel.
- Moved the `import os` statement to before setting the environment variables.
- Changed the order of setting the environment variables to set `PATH` before `PYTHONPATH`.
- Added the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point to the site-packages directory.
- Changed the order of importing `ujson` to after setting the environment variables and appending the site-packages directory to `sys.path`.

This should ensure that the `ujson` module is installed and importable in the Colab notebook.
