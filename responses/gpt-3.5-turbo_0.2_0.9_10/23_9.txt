The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch a browser instance. This can happen due to a number of reasons, such as missing dependencies or incorrect configuration.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure that you have installed the necessary dependencies for Puppeteer to work. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

2. Check if you have installed the necessary dependencies for running a headless browser. Puppeteer requires a version of Chromium to be installed on your system. You can install it by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install puppeteer-core
   ```

3. If you are running the code on a server or in a headless environment, you may need to configure Puppeteer to use a different browser executable. You can do this by passing the `executablePath` option to the `puppeteer.launch()` method. For example:

   ```
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium-browser' });
   ```

4. If you are still experiencing issues, you can try running Puppeteer with the `--no-sandbox` flag. This flag disables the sandboxing feature of Chromium, which can sometimes cause issues in headless environments. For example:

   ```
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox'] });
   ```

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
