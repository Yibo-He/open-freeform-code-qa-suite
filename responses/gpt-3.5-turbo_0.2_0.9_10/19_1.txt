This error occurs when there are too many files being watched by the system. The error message indicates that the maximum number of files that can be watched has been reached. 

To fix this issue, you can try increasing the maximum number of files that can be watched by the system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

This command will increase the maximum number of files that can be watched to 524,288. You can adjust this number as needed.

After running this command, try running `react-native start` again and see if the issue is resolved.
