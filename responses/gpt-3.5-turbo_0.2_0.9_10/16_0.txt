To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Once you have installed Swagger codegen, you can generate a REST client by running the following command in your terminal:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-your-swagger-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-your-swagger-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger spec file, `<language>` with the language you want to generate the client in (e.g. java, python, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to generate the client code.

For example, if you have a Swagger spec file called `swagger.yaml` in your current directory and you want to generate a Java client in a directory called `java-client`, you can run the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.yaml -l java -o java-client
```

3. Once the client code is generated, you can use it to make requests to your REST server. You will need to import the generated client code into your project and use the client's methods to make requests to your server.

Note that the generated client code may need to be customized to fit your specific use case. You can refer to the Swagger codegen documentation for more information on customizing the generated code.
