Yes, you can use the VS Code extension called "Python Interactive" to see the result graphs directly in the VS Code itself. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the "Python Interactive" extension in VS Code.
2. Open the Python file that contains the code you want to run.
3. Click on the "Python Interactive" button in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.
4. A new tab will open with the Python Interactive window. Click on the "+" button to create a new Interactive window.
5. Copy and paste your code into the new Interactive window.
6. Run the code by clicking on the "Run Cell" button or by pressing "Shift+Enter".
7. The result graph will be displayed in the same window.

Here is the modified code that you can use:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Note that the `%matplotlib inline` command is added to the code to display the result graph in the same window.
