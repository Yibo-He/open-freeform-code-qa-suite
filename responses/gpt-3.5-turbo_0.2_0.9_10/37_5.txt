To get the screen height in Android with API level above 30, you can use the following code:

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val insets = windowMetrics.windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.systemBars())

    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom
    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val height = b.height() - insetsHeight

    return height
}
```

In this code, we use the `WindowMetrics` class to obtain the screen height. We subtract the height of the system bars (status bar and navigation bar) from the total height to get the actual usable height of the screen. The `WindowInsets.Type.systemBars()` parameter is used to get the height of the system bars.

Note that this code is only compatible with API level 30 and above. If you need to support older API levels, you can use the deprecated `getSize()` method or use a compatibility library like `androidx.core`.
