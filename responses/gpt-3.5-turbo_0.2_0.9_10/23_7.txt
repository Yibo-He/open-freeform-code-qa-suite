The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch a browser instance. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed Puppeteer by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chromium is not installed: Puppeteer relies on a version of Chromium to run. If Chromium is not installed on your system, Puppeteer will not be able to launch a browser instance. You can install Chromium by running `npm install puppeteer-core` and then specifying the path to the Chromium executable in your code.

3. Insufficient permissions: If you are running the code as a non-root user, you may not have sufficient permissions to launch a browser instance. Try running the code as a root user or granting the necessary permissions to the user running the code.

4. ABI incompatibility: The `checked failed crashForExceptionInNonABIComplianceCodeRange` error message suggests that there may be an ABI incompatibility between the version of Puppeteer you are using and the version of Chromium installed on your system. Try updating Puppeteer to the latest version by running `npm install puppeteer@latest`.
