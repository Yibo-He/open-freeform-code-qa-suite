Yes, I can help you with that. The error message is telling you that you are trying to copy a file to a folder that already exists. You need to specify the full path of the destination file, not just the folder.

Here's the completed function:

```python
from shutil import copyfile

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        # Get the filename from the full path
        filename = item[0].split("/")[-1]
        # Create the full path of the destination file
        destFile = destFolder + "/" + filename
        # Copy the file
        copyfile(item[0], destFile)
```

This function takes in the `fileList` and `destFolder` as parameters. It loops through each item in the `fileList`, gets the filename from the full path, creates the full path of the destination file by concatenating the `destFolder` and the filename, and then copies the file using `copyfile()`.

You can call this function like this:

```python
copy_from_file_list(fileList, "/Users/username/Desktop/testPhotos")
```

This will copy all the files in `fileList` to the `testPhotos` folder on your desktop.
