There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. However, it is recommended to follow the naming convention that is most appropriate for the context of your codebase. If you are using records extensively, it may make sense to use the record-style naming convention for consistency. If you are using traditional Java beans, it may make sense to continue using the `get` and `set` prefix naming convention. Ultimately, the most important thing is to be consistent within your codebase.
