To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub Pages, you can use the `nuxt generate` command to generate the static files and then push them to a GitHub repository. Here are the steps:

1. Make sure your website is configured to generate static files. You can do this by adding the following line to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

   ```
   export default {
     target: 'static'
   }
   ```

2. Run the `nuxt generate` command to generate the static files:

   ```
   npm run generate
   ```

3. This will create a `dist` directory in your project folder. Change into this directory:

   ```
   cd dist
   ```

4. Initialize a new Git repository and commit the files:

   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. Create a new repository on GitHub and push the files to it:

   ```
   git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

6. Finally, go to the repository settings on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages for the `master` branch. Your website should now be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/`.

Note that if your website has dynamic content that depends on user input, you will need to use client-side JavaScript to fetch and display this content. You can do this by creating a single-page application using a framework like Vue.js or React. Nuxt.js has built-in support for creating single-page applications, so you can follow the same deployment steps as above and then add your client-side JavaScript code to fetch and display the dynamic content.
