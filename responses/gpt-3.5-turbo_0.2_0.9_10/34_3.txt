You can use the `valueChanges` event of the `FormControl` to detect changes in the radio group selection and then show/hide the `div` based on the selected value. Here's how you can modify the `div`:

```
<div id='divabc' [hidden]="myform.get('Schedule').value !== 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

This will hide the `div` if the selected value in the radio group is not "abc".
