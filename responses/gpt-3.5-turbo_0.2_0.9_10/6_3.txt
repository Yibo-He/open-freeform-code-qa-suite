It seems like the issue is related to SSL protocol error. You can try accessing the application using HTTP instead of HTTPS by using the following URL: http://localhost:8080. If the application is accessible using HTTP, then the issue is related to SSL configuration.

If you want to access the application using HTTPS, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the SSL certificate is installed correctly. You can check this by opening the URL https://localhost:8080 in a web browser and checking if the SSL certificate is valid.

2. If the SSL certificate is valid, try clearing the browser cache and cookies and then try accessing the application again.

3. If the issue persists, try adding the SSL certificate to the trusted certificates list in your browser.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try disabling SSL in your application by setting the property `server.ssl.enabled` to `false` in the `application.properties` file.

Regarding the Apache installation, it is not necessary to install Apache to access the application in localhost. The application can be accessed directly using the URL http://localhost:8080.
