I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always a good idea to save your work frequently, especially when working with Jupyter Notebook. 

Regarding the error message you saw, it's hard to say without more information. However, it's possible that the error message was related to the notebook's kernel, which is responsible for executing the code in the notebook. If the kernel encounters an error, it can cause the notebook to become unresponsive or stop saving changes.

As for recovering your work, there are a few things you can try:

1. Check the Jupyter Notebook autosave directory: By default, Jupyter Notebook saves autosave files in a directory called `autosave/` in the same directory as the notebook file. You can try looking in this directory for a more recent autosave file.

2. Check the Jupyter Notebook checkpoint directory: Jupyter Notebook also creates checkpoint files that can be used to recover lost work. By default, checkpoint files are saved in a directory called `.ipynb_checkpoints/` in the same directory as the notebook file. You can try opening the most recent checkpoint file to see if it contains your lost work.

3. Use a file recovery tool: If the above methods don't work, you can try using a file recovery tool to recover the deleted or lost notebook file. There are several free and paid file recovery tools available for MacOS that you can try.

I hope one of these methods helps you recover your lost work. In the future, I recommend saving your work frequently and making backups to avoid losing important data.
