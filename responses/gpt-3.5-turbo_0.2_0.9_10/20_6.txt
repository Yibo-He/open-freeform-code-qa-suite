I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always a good practice to save your work frequently, especially when working with Jupyter Notebook.

Regarding the error message you saw, it's hard to say without more information. However, it's possible that the error message was related to a problem with the kernel, which is responsible for executing your code. If the kernel encounters an error, it can cause the notebook to become unresponsive or crash.

As for recovering your work, there are a few things you can try:

1. Check the Jupyter Notebook log: Jupyter Notebook keeps a log of all the activity that occurs in the notebook. You can access the log by running the following command in your terminal: `jupyter notebook --debug`. This will start Jupyter Notebook in debug mode and output the log to your terminal. Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate what went wrong.

2. Check the autosave directory: Jupyter Notebook saves a backup copy of your notebook every few minutes by default. You can check the autosave directory by running the following command in your terminal: `jupyter --paths`. This will output a list of directories, including the autosave directory. Look for a file with a name similar to your notebook but with a `.ipynb_autosave` extension.

3. Use a file recovery tool: If the above methods don't work, you can try using a file recovery tool to recover the deleted file. There are many free and paid tools available for this purpose, such as Recuva, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, and Disk Drill.

I hope one of these methods helps you recover your work. Good luck!
