Yes, I can help you with that. The error message indicates that you are trying to copy a file to a directory that already exists. To fix this, you need to specify the full path of the destination file, not just the directory.

Here's the completed function:

```python
from shutil import copyfile

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        filename = item[0].split("/")[-1]  # get the filename from the full path
        destPath = f"{destFolder}/{filename}"  # create the full path for the destination file
        copyfile(item[0], destPath)
```

In this function, we first extract the filename from the full path using `split("/")[-1]`. Then we create the full path for the destination file by concatenating `destFolder` and `filename`. Finally, we use `copyfile` to copy the file from the source to the destination.
