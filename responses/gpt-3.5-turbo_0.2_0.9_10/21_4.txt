Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the Python interpreter in Colab is not able to find the ujson module even after installing it using conda. To fix this, you can try the following steps:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y ujson aiohttp tqdm

import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages')

import ujson
```

Here, I have made the following changes:

1. Removed the `--prefix` flag from the `conda install` command. This is because we want to install the packages in the default location, which is `/usr/local/anaconda3` in this case.

2. Added `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages` to the `sys.path`. This is the directory where conda installs the packages by default.

3. Imported `ujson` after adding the path to `sys.path`.

I hope this helps!
