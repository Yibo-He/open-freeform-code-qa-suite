This error message usually occurs when the Go language server is unable to find the package in the GoPath. Here are some steps you can try to solve this issue:

1. Make sure that the Redigo package is installed in your GoPath. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis`

2. Check that your GoPath is set correctly. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `echo $GOPATH`. This should return the path to your GoPath.

3. If the above steps do not work, try restarting VSCode and rebuilding your project.

4. If the issue still persists, try adding the following line to your `go.mod` file: `replace github.com/gomodule/redigo => github.com/gomodule/redigo v2.0.0`. This will force the use of version 2.0.0 of the Redigo package.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and allow VSCode to recognize the Redigo package.
