To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias like `@styles`, you need to add the alias to your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example of how to do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

In this example, we're setting the `baseUrl` to the root directory of our project, and then defining an alias for `@styles/*` that maps to `src/styled/*`.

Once you've added this to your `jsconfig.json` file, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and have IntelliSense work as expected. For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

Note that you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.
