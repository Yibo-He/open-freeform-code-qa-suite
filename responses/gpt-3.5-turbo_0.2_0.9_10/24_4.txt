There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14 in new code. However, it is recommended to follow the naming convention that is most appropriate for the context of your codebase. If you are using records extensively, it may make sense to use the `name()` convention for consistency. If you are using traditional Java beans, it may make sense to continue using the `getName()` convention. Ultimately, the most important thing is to be consistent within your codebase.
