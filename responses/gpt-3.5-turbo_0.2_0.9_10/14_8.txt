To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages, you can use the following steps:

1. First, ensure that your website is configured to generate a static site. You can do this by adding the following line to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```
export default {
  target: 'static'
}
```

2. Next, build your website using the following command:

```
npm run generate
```

This will generate a static version of your website in the `dist` directory.

3. Create a new repository on GitHub and push your website files to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

4. Finally, enable GitHub Pages for your repository by going to the repository settings and selecting the `gh-pages` branch as the source.

Once you have completed these steps, your Nuxt.js static website will be deployed to GitHub Pages and will be accessible at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.
