To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub Pages, you can use the `nuxt generate` command to generate the static files and then push them to a GitHub repository. Here are the steps:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and a repository set up for your website.
2. Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency by running `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`.
3. In your `nuxt.config.js` file, set the `generate` property to the following:

```
generate: {
  fallback: true
}
```

This will generate a single HTML file for each page, which is necessary for deploying as a single page application.

4. In your `package.json` file, add the following scripts:

```
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "npm run generate && gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

This script will generate the static files and then deploy them to GitHub Pages.

5. Run the `npm run deploy` command to deploy your website. This will generate the static files and push them to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

6. Finally, go to your repository settings on GitHub and set the GitHub Pages source to the `gh-pages` branch.

After these steps, your website should be deployed as a single page application on GitHub Pages.
