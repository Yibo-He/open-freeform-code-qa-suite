Yes, there is a way to delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter in a single shot. You can use the `clear()` method of the `SharedPreferences` class to delete all the saved preferences.

Here's an example code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

// Get the instance of SharedPreferences
SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();

// Clear all saved preferences
await prefs.clear();
```

You can call this code when the user taps on the logout button to delete all the saved preferences.
