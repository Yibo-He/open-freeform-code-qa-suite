The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch a browser process. This can happen due to various reasons such as missing dependencies, incompatible versions, or permission issues.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure you have installed the latest version of Puppeteer and its dependencies. You can do this by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Check if you have installed the required dependencies for running Puppeteer. Puppeteer requires some system-level dependencies to run, such as `libx11-xcb1`, `libxcb1`, `libxcomposite1`, `libxdamage1`, `libxi6`, `libxtst6`, `libnss3`, `libcups2`, `libxss1`, `libxrandr2`, `libasound2`, and `libatk1.0-0`. You can install these dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian by running `sudo apt-get install libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxi6 libxtst6 libnss3 libcups2 libxss1 libxrandr2 libasound2 libatk1.0-0`.

3. If you are running Puppeteer on a remote server, make sure you have the necessary permissions to launch a browser process. You can try running the code with `sudo` or as a superuser to see if it resolves the issue.

4. If none of the above steps work, try launching the browser process with the `--no-sandbox` flag. This flag disables the sandboxing feature of Chromium, which can sometimes cause issues. You can do this by adding the following line of code before launching the browser:

   ```
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox'] });
   ```

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
