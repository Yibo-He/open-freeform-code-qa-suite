Yes, you can use the built-in Jupyter Notebook integration in Visual Studio Code to display the plot inline. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

The `%matplotlib inline` command tells Matplotlib to display the plot inline in the output cell of the Jupyter Notebook. The `#%%` at the beginning of the code block is a cell separator that is used by Jupyter Notebooks, but it's not necessary in Visual Studio Code.

Once you've added these lines to your code, you can run it in Visual Studio Code and the plot will be displayed inline in the output cell.
