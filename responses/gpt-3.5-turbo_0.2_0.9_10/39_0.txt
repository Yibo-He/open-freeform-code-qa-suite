It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the libraries are included in your project: Make sure that the libraries (AFNetworking, JSONModel, ReactiveCocoa, Realm, SAMKeychain, and Sentry) are included in your project and are not missing.

2. Check if the library search paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and check if the library search paths are correct. Make sure that the paths to the libraries are correct and that they exist on your system.

3. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Check if the libraries are installed correctly using CocoaPods. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```
pod install
```

4. Check if the libraries are up to date: Check if the libraries are up to date by running the following command in your project directory:

```
pod outdated
```

If any of the libraries are outdated, you can update them by running the following command:

```
pod update
```

5. Clean and rebuild your project: Clean your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode. Then, rebuild your project by going to Product > Build.

6. Check if the library files are in the correct location: Check if the library files are in the correct location by going to the directory where the libraries are installed and checking if the files are present.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try creating a new Xcode project and adding the required libraries to it. This should fix any issues related to missing or incorrect library files.
