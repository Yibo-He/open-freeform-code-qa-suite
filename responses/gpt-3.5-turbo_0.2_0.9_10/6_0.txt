It seems like you are encountering an SSL protocol error when trying to access your app at `https://localhost:8080`. This error can occur due to various reasons, such as an invalid SSL certificate or an outdated browser.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Try accessing the app using `http://localhost:8080` instead of `https://localhost:8080`. This will bypass the SSL protocol and allow you to access the app over an unsecured connection.

2. Check if your browser is up-to-date and supports the latest SSL protocols. If not, try updating your browser to the latest version.

3. Check if your SSL certificate is valid and not expired. If it is expired, you can generate a new SSL certificate and install it on your server.

4. Check if there are any firewalls or antivirus software blocking the connection to your app. You can try disabling them temporarily and see if it resolves the issue.

Regarding your question about Apache, it is not necessary to install Apache to access your app at `localhost`. Spring Boot has an embedded web server that can serve your app on `localhost`. The issue you are facing is most likely related to SSL protocol and port configuration.
