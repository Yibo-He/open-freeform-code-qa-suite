There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. However, it is recommended to follow the convention of the codebase you are working on. If the codebase is already using the Java bean convention, it might be better to stick with it for consistency. If the codebase is adopting the new record feature, it might be better to use the new naming convention for consistency. Ultimately, the most important thing is to be consistent within the codebase.
