It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Make sure that the required libraries (AFNetworking, JSONModel, ReactiveCocoa, Realm, SAMKeychain, and Sentry) are installed correctly and are present in the project directory.

2. Check the library search paths: Go to your project's Build Settings and check the Library Search Paths. Make sure that the paths to the required libraries are correct and that they are included in the search paths.

3. Check the Frameworks and Libraries: Go to your project's Build Phases and check the Frameworks and Libraries. Make sure that the required libraries are included in the list and that they are not marked as red.

4. Check the Pods project: If you are using CocoaPods, check the Pods project. Make sure that the required libraries are included in the Pods project and that they are not marked as red.

5. Clean the project: Clean your project by going to Product > Clean. Then try building the project again.

6. Check the deployment target: Make sure that the deployment target for your project is set correctly. If the libraries require a higher deployment target than what you have set, you may encounter issues.

7. Check the Xcode version: Make sure that you are using the latest version of Xcode. If not, try updating Xcode and see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to provide more information about your project and the libraries you are using to get a more specific solution.
