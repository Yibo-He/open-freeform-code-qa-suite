Certainly! Here's an implementation of the `transform` function that should do what you're looking for:

```
from io import BytesIO
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    # Save the figure to an in-memory buffer
    buf = BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)

    # Open the buffer as an image with PIL
    img = Image.open(buf)

    return img
```

This function saves the `Figure` object to an in-memory buffer using the `savefig` method with the `format` parameter set to `'png'`. It then seeks back to the beginning of the buffer and opens it as an image using the `Image.open` method from PIL. Finally, it returns the resulting `Image` object.

Note that this implementation assumes that you want to save the figure as a PNG image. If you want to use a different image format, you'll need to adjust the `format` parameter accordingly.
