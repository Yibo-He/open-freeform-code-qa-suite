To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to configure the `paths` property in your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we set the `baseUrl` to the current directory and define a path alias `@styles` that maps to the `src/styled` directory.

After configuring this, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and have IntelliSense work properly.

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

When you hover over `@styles/Button` in VSCode, it should show the path to the module and allow you to click on it to open the file.
