You can use the `plt.hist()` function to plot the histogram. Here's the complete code:

```
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
    x = np.random.randn(100000)
    plt.hist(x, bins=20)
    plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

draw_histogram()
```

The `plt.hist()` function takes the data `x` as the first argument and the number of bins as the `bins` argument. The `plt.savefig()` function saves the figure as a PDF file named `figure.pdf`.
