Sure, here's the completed code:

```
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
    x = np.random.randn(100000)
    plt.hist(x, bins=20)
    plt.savefig('figure.pdf')
```

This code generates 100,000 random numbers from a normal distribution using `np.random.randn()`, then plots a histogram with 20 bins using `plt.hist()`. Finally, it saves the histogram figure into `figure.pdf` using `plt.savefig()`.
