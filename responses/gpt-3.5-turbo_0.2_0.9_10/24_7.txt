There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. It's up to the developer or team to decide which naming convention to use. However, it's recommended to be consistent within the codebase to avoid confusion and improve readability. If you decide to use records, it's best to stick with the default naming convention of using the field name as the getter method name. If you decide to stick with the Java bean convention, you can continue to use the `getName()` method name.
