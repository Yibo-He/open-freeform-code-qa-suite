To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Once you have installed Swagger codegen, you can generate a REST client by running the following command in your terminal:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-your-swagger-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-your-swagger-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger spec file, `<language>` with the language you want to generate the client in (e.g. Java, Python, Ruby, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to save the generated code.

For example, if you want to generate a Java client for a Swagger spec file located at `/path/to/your/swagger/spec.yaml`, you can run the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i /path/to/your/swagger/spec.yaml -l java -o /path/to/your/output/directory
```

3. Once the code generation is complete, you can import the generated code into your project and use it to make REST API calls to your server.

Note that you will need to have a valid Swagger spec file that describes your REST API in order to generate a client using Swagger codegen. If you don't have a Swagger spec file, you can create one using the Swagger Editor or Swagger UI.
