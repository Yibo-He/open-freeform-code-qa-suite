The first error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle` is related to the `location` package. It seems like you are missing the `location_web` plugin in your project. To fix this, you can add the following line to your `settings.gradle` file:

```
include ':location_web'
```

If the `settings.gradle` file does not exist, create it in the same directory as your `build.gradle` file.

The second error message `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to convert a `Future` object to a `String` using the `toString()` method. Instead, you should wait for the `Future` to complete and then use the result.

To fix this, you can use a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously build your UI based on the result of the `_getUserLocation()` function. Here's an example:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Text("Error: ${snapshot.error}");
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code uses a `FutureBuilder` widget to build the UI based on the result of the `_getUserLocation()` function. If the `Future` completes successfully, it displays the image using the URL returned by the function. If there is an error, it displays an error message. If the `Future` is still running, it displays a loading indicator.
