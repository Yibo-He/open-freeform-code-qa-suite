It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and check if the library search paths are correct. Make sure they point to the correct directories where the libraries are located.

2. Check if the libraries are included in your project: Go to your project's Build Phases and check if the required libraries are included in the "Link Binary With Libraries" section. If they are not included, add them by clicking on the "+" button.

3. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Make sure the required libraries are installed correctly using CocoaPods. You can try running `pod install` again to reinstall the libraries.

4. Clean your project: Try cleaning your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode. Then try building your project again.

5. Check if the library files are present: Check if the library files are present in the directories mentioned in the error message. If they are not present, try reinstalling the libraries.

6. Check if the library files are corrupted: Check if the library files are corrupted by deleting them and reinstalling them using CocoaPods.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will work for you.
