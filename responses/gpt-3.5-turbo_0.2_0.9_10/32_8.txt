The error message suggests that the requested version-platform combination does not exist. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The version of mongodb-memory-server you are using is outdated and does not support the requested version-platform combination. Try updating to the latest version.

2. The version-platform combination you are requesting is not supported by mongodb-memory-server. Check the mongodb-memory-server documentation to see which versions and platforms are supported.

3. There is a temporary issue with the mirror that mongodb-memory-server is using to download the required binaries. Try running the tests again later.

You can also try setting the `MONGOMS_DOWNLOAD_URL` environment variable to a different mirror to see if that resolves the issue. For example:

```
MONGOMS_DOWNLOAD_URL=https://downloads.mongodb.org
``` 

This will set the download URL to the official MongoDB download site.
