Yes, you can use the `FigureCanvasAgg` class from the `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` module to render the `Figure` to a `numpy` array, and then use the `Image.fromarray` method from the `PIL` module to create a `PIL.Image` object. Here's the completed code:

```
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def transform(input: Figure) -> Image:
    canvas = FigureCanvasAgg(input)
    canvas.draw()
    buf = canvas.buffer_rgba()
    data = np.asarray(buf)
    image = Image.fromarray(data, mode='RGBA')
    return image
```

This function takes a `Figure` object as input and returns a `PIL.Image` object. The `FigureCanvasAgg` class is used to render the `Figure` to a `numpy` array, which is then converted to a `PIL.Image` object using the `Image.fromarray` method.
