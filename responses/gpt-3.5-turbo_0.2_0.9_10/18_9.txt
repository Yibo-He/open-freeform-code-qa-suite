This error occurs because VSCode is unable to find the package data for the Redigo package. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the Redigo package is installed in your GoPath. You can install it using the following command:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if the package is installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```
   go list -m github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   This should output the version of the package that you have installed.

3. If the package is installed correctly, try restarting VSCode and see if the error goes away.

4. If the error still persists, try adding the following line to your `go.mod` file:

   ```
   replace github.com/gomodule/redigo => github.com/gomodule/redigo v2.0.0+incompatible
   ```

   This will force Go to use version 2.0.0 of the Redigo package, which is compatible with the current version of Go.

5. Save the `go.mod` file and restart VSCode. The error should now be resolved.

If none of these steps work, you can try reinstalling the Redigo package or updating your version of Go.
