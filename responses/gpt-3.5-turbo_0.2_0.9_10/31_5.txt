Yes, you can clone, commit, and push using personal access tokens. The steps you mentioned are correct. Here is a summary of the steps:

1. Clone the repository using the personal access token:
```
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```
2. Change to the cloned repository directory:
```
cd /path/to/cloned/repository
```
3. Make changes to the repository and commit them:
```
git commit --allow-empty -m 'Commit message'
```
4. Push the changes to the remote repository using the personal access token:
```
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```
Make sure to replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your own values.
