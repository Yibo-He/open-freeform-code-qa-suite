Yes, you can use the `FigureCanvasAgg` class from `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` to render the figure to a `numpy` array, and then use that array to create a `PIL.Image` object. Here's the completed code:

```
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: Figure) -> Image:
    # Create a canvas for rendering the figure
    canvas = FigureCanvasAgg(input)
    canvas.draw()

    # Get the numpy array of the rendered figure
    buf = canvas.buffer_rgba()
    w, h = canvas.get_width_height()
    img_array = np.asarray(buf, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(h, w, 4)

    # Create a PIL Image object from the numpy array
    img = Image.fromarray(img_array)

    return img
```

Note that we're using the `FigureCanvasAgg` class to render the figure to a buffer, and then converting that buffer to a numpy array. We then reshape the array to the correct dimensions and create a `PIL.Image` object from it.
