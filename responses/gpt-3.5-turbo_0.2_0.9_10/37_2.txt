To get the screen height in Android with API level above 30, you can use the following code:

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val insets = windowMetrics.windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.systemBars())

    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom
    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val height = b.height() - insetsHeight

    return height
}
```

In this code, we use the `WindowMetrics` class to obtain the screen height. We also use the `WindowInsets` class to obtain the height of the system bars (status bar and navigation bar) and subtract it from the total screen height to get the usable screen height.
