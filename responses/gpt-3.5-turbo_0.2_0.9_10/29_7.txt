You can use the `plt.hist()` function from Matplotlib to plot the histogram. Here is the complete code:

```
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
    x = np.random.randn(100000)
    plt.hist(x, bins=20)
    plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

draw_histogram()
```

The `plt.hist()` function takes the data `x` and the number of bins as arguments. In this case, we set the number of bins to 20. Finally, we save the figure using `plt.savefig()`.
