I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always a good idea to save your work frequently and make backups to avoid losing important data.

Regarding your issue, it's possible that the error message you saw was related to a problem with the notebook's kernel. If the kernel encounters an error, it may stop executing code and prevent the notebook from saving properly. This could explain why your work wasn't saved even though you clicked on `Save and Checkpoint`.

One thing you can try is to restart the kernel and see if your work reappears. To do this, go to the `Kernel` menu and select `Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs...`. This will clear the output of all cells and reset the kernel. Then, run the cells again and see if your work is still there.

If this doesn't work, you can try to recover your work from the autosave file. To do this, go to the `File` menu and select `Revert to Checkpoint`. This will open a list of all the available checkpoints for the notebook. Select the checkpoint that was created closest to the time when you lost your work and click `Restore`. This should restore the notebook to the state it was in at that checkpoint.

If neither of these options work, unfortunately, it may not be possible to recover your work.
