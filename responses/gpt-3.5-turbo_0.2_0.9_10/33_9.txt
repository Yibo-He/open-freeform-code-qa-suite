The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` indicates that the `location_web` plugin is missing or not properly configured in your project. To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `settings.gradle` file in your project and add the following line:

```
include ':location_web'
```

2. Save the file and run the command `flutter packages get` in your terminal to update the dependencies.

3. If the error persists, try running the command `flutter clean` to clean the project and then run `flutter packages get` again.

Regarding the second error message `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems that you are trying to display a `Future` object as an image. To fix this error, you can use a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously load the image from the URL returned by `_getUserLocation()` function. Here's an example:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Text("${snapshot.error}");
        }
        return CircularProgressIndicator();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code uses a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously load the image from the URL returned by `_getUserLocation()` function. If the future has data, it displays the image using the `Image.network` widget. If the future has an error, it displays the error message. If the future is still loading, it displays a `CircularProgressIndicator`.
