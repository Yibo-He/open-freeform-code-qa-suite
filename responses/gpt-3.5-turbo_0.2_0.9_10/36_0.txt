The error message suggests that the Feign client is not able to find a load balancer. This is because the `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign` dependency does not include the Ribbon load balancer by default. 

To resolve this issue, you can add the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency to your `pom.xml` file. This will provide the necessary load balancer for your Feign client.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After adding this dependency, you should be able to use the Feign client without any issues.
