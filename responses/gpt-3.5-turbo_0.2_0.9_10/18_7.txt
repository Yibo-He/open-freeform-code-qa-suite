This error occurs when the Go language server is unable to find the package data for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package. To solve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the `redigo` package is installed correctly. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if the package is installed in the correct location. The package should be installed in the `GOPATH` directory. You can check the location of your `GOPATH` by running the following command:

   ```
   go env GOPATH
   ```

   The output of this command should be the path to your `GOPATH` directory.

3. If the package is installed in the correct location, try restarting VSCode and see if the error goes away.

4. If the error still persists, try adding the following line to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

   ```
   "gopls": {"experimentalWorkspaceModule": true}
   ```

   This will enable experimental workspace module support in the Go language server.

5. If none of the above steps work, try deleting the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files in your project directory and running `go mod init` again to recreate them.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and allow you to use intellisense suggestions in VSCode for the `redigo` package.
