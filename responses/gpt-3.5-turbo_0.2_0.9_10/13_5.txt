A List is a view that displays a collection of rows whereas ForEach is a view that iterates over a collection of data and applies a view builder to each element in the collection. In other words, List is a specific type of view that displays a collection of data in a scrollable list, while ForEach is a more general-purpose view that can be used to iterate over any collection of data and apply a view builder to each element. You can use ForEach to create a List, but you can also use it to create other types of views, such as a grid or a stack.
