Yes, you can use the `FigureCanvasAgg` class from `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` to render the figure to a `numpy` array, and then use the `Image.fromarray` method from `PIL` to create an image from the array. Here's the completed code:

```
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def transform(input: Figure) -> Image:
    canvas = FigureCanvasAgg(input)
    canvas.draw()
    buf = canvas.buffer_rgba()
    w, h = input.canvas.get_width_height()
    return Image.frombytes("RGBA", (w, h), buf, "raw", "RGBA")
```

This function takes a `Figure` object as input, creates a `FigureCanvasAgg` object from it, renders the figure to a `numpy` array using the `buffer_rgba` method, and then creates a `PIL.Image` object from the array using the `frombytes` method. The resulting image can then be returned.
