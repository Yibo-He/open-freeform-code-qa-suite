The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch the browser process. This can happen for a few reasons:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed the Puppeteer library by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chrome is not installed: Puppeteer relies on the Chrome browser to run. Make sure that Chrome is installed on your system.

3. Chrome is not in the expected location: Puppeteer expects to find Chrome in a specific location. If Chrome is installed in a non-standard location, you may need to specify the path to Chrome when launching Puppeteer. You can do this by passing a `executablePath` option to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

4. Permissions issue: Puppeteer may not have the necessary permissions to launch Chrome. Try running your code with elevated privileges or as an administrator.

5. ABI compatibility issue: The error message `checked failed crashForExceptionInNonABIComplianceCodeRange` suggests that there may be an issue with ABI compatibility. This can happen if you are using an incompatible version of Puppeteer or Chrome. Try updating to the latest version of both libraries.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that Puppeteer is installed by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Check that Chrome is installed on your system.

3. If Chrome is installed in a non-standard location, pass the `executablePath` option to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

4. Try running your code with elevated privileges or as an administrator.

5. Update to the latest version of Puppeteer and Chrome to ensure ABI compatibility.
