There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. However, it is recommended to follow the naming convention that is most appropriate for the context of your codebase. If you are using records extensively, it may make sense to use the record-style naming convention (`person.name()`) consistently throughout your codebase. If you are using a mix of records and traditional Java beans, you may want to consider using a consistent naming convention across all classes, such as always using the traditional Java bean naming convention (`person.getName()`). Ultimately, the most important thing is to be consistent within your codebase.
