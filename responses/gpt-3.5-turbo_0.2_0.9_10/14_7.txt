To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub Pages, you can use the `nuxt generate` command to generate the static files and then push them to a GitHub repository. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and a repository set up for your website.
2. Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency by running `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`.
3. In your `nuxt.config.js` file, add the following configuration:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...
  generate: {
    dir: 'dist'
  },
  router: {
    base: '/<repository-name>/'
  }
}
```

Replace `<repository-name>` with the name of your GitHub repository.

4. In your `package.json` file, add the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "npm run generate && gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

5. Run the `npm run deploy` command to generate the static files and deploy them to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

After the deployment is complete, your website should be accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
