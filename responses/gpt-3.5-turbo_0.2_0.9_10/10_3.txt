Yes, there is a way to delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter in a single shot. You can use the `SharedPreferences.clear()` method to remove all key-value pairs from the shared preferences.

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

Future<void> logout() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
  // Other logout logic
}
```

In this example, we first get an instance of the shared preferences using `SharedPreferences.getInstance()`. Then, we call the `clear()` method to remove all key-value pairs from the shared preferences. Finally, you can add any other logout logic that you need.

Note that calling `clear()` will remove all data stored in the shared preferences, so make sure that this is what you want to do before implementing it in your app.
