To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to add the alias to your `jsconfig.json` file. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we've added an alias `@styles` that maps to the `src/styled` directory. Now, when you import a module using the `@styles` alias, VSCode will be able to IntelliSense the module path and allow you to access it by clicking on it.

Here's an example import statement using the `@styles` alias:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

With this configuration, VSCode will be able to IntelliSense the `Button` module and allow you to access it by clicking on it.
