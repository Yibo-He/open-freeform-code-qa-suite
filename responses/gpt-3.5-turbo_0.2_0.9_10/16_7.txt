To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen: You can install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Generate the Swagger specification: You need to generate the Swagger specification for your REST server. You can do this by using a tool like Swagger Editor or Swagger UI. Once you have the Swagger specification, save it as a JSON or YAML file.

3. Generate the REST client: Use the following command to generate the REST client:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-swagger-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-swagger-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client in (e.g. java, python, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to save the generated code.

For example, if you want to generate a Java client for your Swagger specification file located at `/path/to/swagger.json` and save the generated code in the directory `/path/to/output`, you can use the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i /path/to/swagger.json -l java -o /path/to/output
```

4. Use the generated client: Once the client is generated, you can use it in your application to consume the REST API provided by your server. The generated code will include classes and methods that you can use to make requests to the server and handle the responses.

That's it! You now have a REST client generated using Swagger codegen that you can use to consume the REST API provided by your server.
