There is no official or semi-official guideline on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. However, it is recommended to follow the naming convention that is most appropriate for your codebase and team. If you are using records, it makes sense to use the generated getter method names. If you are using traditional Java beans, it makes sense to use the `get` and `set` method names. Consistency within your codebase is key, so choose a naming convention and stick to it.
