Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter using the `SharedPreferences` package. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

// Get the shared preferences instance
SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();

// Remove all saved preferences
await prefs.clear();
```

The `clear()` method removes all key-value pairs from the shared preferences. You can call this method when the user taps on logout to delete all saved preferences in a single shot.
