The error message suggests that there is no Feign client for load balancing defined and asks if you have forgotten to include the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency. This is because Feign uses Ribbon for load balancing by default. 

Since you are using Spring Boot version 2.0.8, you can use the `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` dependency instead of `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon`. 

Try adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This should resolve the issue.
