A List is a view that displays a collection of rows whereas ForEach is a view struct that iterates over a collection of data and generates views dynamically. In other words, List is a pre-built view that displays a collection of data in a specific way, while ForEach is a tool that allows you to generate views dynamically based on a collection of data. You can use ForEach to create a custom list view or to generate any other type of view that requires dynamic content.
