A List is a view that displays a collection of rows whereas ForEach is a view struct that iterates over a collection of data and generates views dynamically. In other words, List is a predefined view that displays a collection of data in a specific way, while ForEach is a flexible view struct that can be used to generate views in a variety of ways, including within a List. You can use ForEach to iterate over a collection of data and generate a view for each element in the collection, and then embed the ForEach view within a List to display the generated views in a scrollable list.
