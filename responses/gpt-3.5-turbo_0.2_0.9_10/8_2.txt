Sure! Here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  var newDate = new Date(date.getTime() + date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
  newDate.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return newDate;
}
```

Here's how it works:

1. We start by creating a new `Date` object based on the input date. We add the timezone offset (in minutes) to the time to get the UTC time.
2. We then set the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds of the new date to 0, effectively resetting it to midnight UTC.
3. Finally, we return the new date object.

Note that this function assumes that you want to convert the input date to midnight UTC. If you want to convert it to a different time of day, you'll need to adjust the `setUTCHours()` call accordingly.
