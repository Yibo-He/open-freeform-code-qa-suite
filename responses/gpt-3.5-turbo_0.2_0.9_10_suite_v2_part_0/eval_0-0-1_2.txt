When deploying a NextJS app to Vercel, you need to make sure that your app is properly configured for serverless deployment. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Create a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project if you don't have one already. This file is necessary for configuring your NextJS app for serverless deployment. 

2. In your `next.config.js` file, add the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

This tells NextJS to build your app for serverless deployment.

3. Make sure that your dynamic routes are properly defined. For example, if you have a dynamic route `/posts/[id].js`, make sure that you have a file named `[id].js` in the `pages/posts` directory.

4. Check your Vercel deployment logs for any errors. You can access the logs by clicking on the "Logs" button in the Vercel dashboard.

5. If you're still having issues, try running `yarn run build` locally and then deploying the `out` directory to Vercel instead of deploying the entire project directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
