It seems that the issue is related to the network connection. The `uri` you are using in the `ApolloClient` configuration is not working properly. 

You can try changing the `uri` to a different endpoint that works, for example, the following:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

This endpoint provides a GraphQL API for Pokemon data, and it works with the `EXCHANGE_RATES` query you are using in your code.

If you still have issues with the network connection, you can try adding the `networkError` property to the `useQuery` hook to see if there are any errors related to the network:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data, networkError } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

console.log(loading, error, data, networkError);
```

This will log any network errors that occur during the query.
