This error occurs because Bootstrap 4 requires Popper.js as a dependency. To fix this error, you need to install Popper.js as a dependency in your project.

You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install popper.js --save
```

This will install Popper.js and add it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your JavaScript file before importing Bootstrap. Here's an example:

```
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap';
```

Make sure to import Popper before Bootstrap, as Bootstrap depends on Popper.

After making these changes, try compiling your project again. The error should be resolved.
