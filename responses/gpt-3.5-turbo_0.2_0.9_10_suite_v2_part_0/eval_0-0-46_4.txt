The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting and analyzing JavaScript code. It seems that ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but is unable to find it.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is already there, then you can try specifying the full path to the file in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

To do this, replace the following line in your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

with:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This should tell ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project.

If this does not work, you can also try running the following command in your terminal to clear the ESLint cache:

```
npx eslint --clear-cache
```

This should clear any cached information that ESLint has about your project and force it to re-read your configuration files.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
