When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are used by tools like debuggers to allow you to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser or in a code editor.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser or in a code editor. However, this can result in smaller file sizes and faster compilation times, as the compiler does not need to generate the source map files.

So, if you set `"sourceMap": false`, you may not notice any immediate change in your app, but it may affect your ability to debug your code in the future.
