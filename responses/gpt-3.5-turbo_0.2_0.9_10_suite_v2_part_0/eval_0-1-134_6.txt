It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a tool that allows you to write HTML and CSS code faster and more efficiently. Emmet uses abbreviations to generate code snippets, such as `.classname` for a div with a class name. 

To use Emmet, you need to have it installed in your code editor. Most popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom, have Emmet built-in or available as an extension. 

Once you have Emmet installed, you can use its abbreviations to generate code snippets. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing the Tab key will generate `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If you're still having trouble, make sure that Emmet is enabled in your code editor's settings and that you're using the correct syntax for the abbreviation. You can find more information and a list of Emmet abbreviations on the official Emmet website.
