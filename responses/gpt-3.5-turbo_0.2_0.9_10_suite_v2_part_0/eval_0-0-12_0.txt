The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you provided are not accepted by Gmail. There are a few things you can try to fix this:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, then clicking on "Security" and scrolling down to "Less secure app access". Turn this option on.

2. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Google account, you will need to generate an app password to use instead of your regular password. You can generate an app password by going to your Google Account settings, then clicking on "Security" and scrolling down to "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use that instead of your regular password in your code.

3. If neither of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "DisplayUnlockCaptcha" in your Google account settings. This will allow you to log in to your account from a new device or app. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, then click on "Security" and scroll down to "Third-party apps with account access". Click on "Manage third-party access" and then click on "Continue" under "DisplayUnlockCaptcha". 

After trying these solutions, run your code again and see if the error persists.
