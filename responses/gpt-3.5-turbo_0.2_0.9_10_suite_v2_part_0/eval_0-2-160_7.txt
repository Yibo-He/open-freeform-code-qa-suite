When you set `"sourceMap": false` in `tsconfig.json`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate a source map file for your Angular application. A source map is a file that maps the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, which is useful for debugging purposes.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the generated JavaScript code will not have a reference to the original TypeScript code. This means that if you encounter an error in the JavaScript code, you will not be able to see the corresponding TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your Angular application, as the browser does not need to download and parse the source map file. This can be particularly useful in production environments where performance is critical.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` will not have any visible effect on your Angular application, but it can improve performance by reducing the size of the files that need to be downloaded by the browser.
