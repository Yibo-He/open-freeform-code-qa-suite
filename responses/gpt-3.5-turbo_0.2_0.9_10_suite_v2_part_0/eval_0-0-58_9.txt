The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of the package fails. This error can be resolved by trying the following measures:

1. Clearing the cache: Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the cache and try running `npm install` again.

2. Updating npm: Update npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and try running `npm install` again.

3. Removing `node_modules`: Remove the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

4. Disabling package-lock.json: Add `"package-lock": false` to your `package.json` file, remove the `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` again.

5. Verifying package integrity: Verify the integrity of the package by running `npm install --verify` and try running `npm install` again.

6. Using yarn: Try using yarn instead of npm by running `yarn install` and see if the issue persists.

If none of the above measures work, you may need to contact the package maintainer or seek further assistance.
