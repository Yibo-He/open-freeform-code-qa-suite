When deploying a NextJS app to Vercel, it is important to ensure that the app is properly configured for deployment. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check the Vercel logs: Vercel provides detailed logs for each deployment. Check the logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that could be causing the issue.

2. Check the file structure: Make sure that the file structure of your app is correct. Vercel expects the pages to be in the `pages` directory and the API routes to be in the `api` directory. If your app has a different file structure, you may need to configure Vercel to use a custom build command.

3. Check the dynamic route: If you have a dynamic route in your app, make sure that it is properly configured. Dynamic routes in NextJS require a specific file naming convention. For example, a dynamic route with the path `/posts/[id]` would require a file named `pages/posts/[id].js`.

4. Check the build command: Make sure that the build command in your `package.json` file is correct. The build command for a NextJS app should be `next build`.

5. Check the Vercel configuration: Make sure that your Vercel configuration is correct. You can configure your app's settings in the Vercel dashboard.

If none of these steps solve the issue, you may need to provide more information about your app's configuration and file structure.
