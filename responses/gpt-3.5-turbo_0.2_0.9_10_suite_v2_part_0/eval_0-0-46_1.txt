The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting and analyzing JavaScript code. It seems that ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file, which is needed to properly analyze TypeScript code.

To fix this issue, you need to update your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file. In your current configuration, ESLint is looking for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. However, based on your project structure, it seems that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project.

To update your configuration, you can simply change the `project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file. Here's what your updated `.eslintrc.js` file should look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings",
    "plugin:import/typescript",
  ],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // updated path to tsconfig.json
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: [
    "@typescript-eslint",
    "import",
  ],
  rules: {
    // your rules here
  },
  settings: {
    jsdoc: {
      tagNamePreference: {
        returns: "return",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

After making this change, you should no longer see the error message in your `.ts` files.
