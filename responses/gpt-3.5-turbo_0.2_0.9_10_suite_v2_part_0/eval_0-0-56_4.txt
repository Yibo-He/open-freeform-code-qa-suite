It seems like the issue is with the way you are exposing the ports in your Docker container. When you run the command `docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app bash`, you are publishing the container's port 8080 to your host machine's port 8080. However, in your `vite.config.ts` file, you have set the server port to 8080, which means that the Vite server is listening on the container's port 8080.

To fix this issue, you can either change the server port in your `vite.config.ts` file to 8081 (or any other available port), or you can change the port mapping in your `docker-compose.yml` file to map the container's port 8080 to a different port on your host machine, like this:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "8081:8080" # map container's port 8080 to host machine's port 8081
```

Then, when you run the command `docker-compose run --publish 8081:8080 --rm app bash`, the Vite server should be accessible at `localhost:8081` on your host machine.
