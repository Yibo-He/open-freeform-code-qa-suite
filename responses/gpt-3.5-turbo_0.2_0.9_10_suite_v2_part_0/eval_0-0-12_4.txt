The error message you are getting indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not being accepted. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "Less secure app access". Make sure that this option is turned on.

2. Double-check that you are using the correct username and password. Make sure that there are no typos or errors in the credentials you are providing.

3. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Google account, you will need to generate an "App password" to use instead of your regular password. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use that instead of your regular password in your Node.js code.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "Unlock Captcha" for your Google account. This can be done by going to this link: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha. Click on the "Continue" button and then try running your Node.js code again.

I hope one of these solutions helps you fix the issue!
