The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a problem with the `npm` executable file. It seems like the file has Windows line endings, which is causing the error. You can fix this issue by converting the line endings of the `npm` file to Unix format.

To do this, you can use the `dos2unix` command. First, you need to install `dos2unix` by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
```

Once `dos2unix` is installed, you can convert the line endings of the `npm` file by running the following command:

```
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

After running this command, try running `npm -v` again and it should work without any errors.
