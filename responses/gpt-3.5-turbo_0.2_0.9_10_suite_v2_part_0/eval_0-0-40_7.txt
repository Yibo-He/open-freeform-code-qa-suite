The error message you received indicates that there is an issue with the interpreter for `npm`. This could be caused by a few different things, but one common cause is that the file has Windows line endings (`\r\n`) instead of Unix line endings (`\n`).

To fix this issue, you can try running the following command to convert the line endings of the `npm` file:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This will install the `dos2unix` utility and use it to convert the line endings of the `npm` file to Unix format.

After running this command, try running `npm -v` again to see if the issue has been resolved.
