The error message is telling you that you should use a string or a number as the key for the `v-for` loop instead of using the entire `comment` object. 

To fix this, you can change the `:key` binding to use a unique identifier of the `comment` object, such as its `id` property. For example:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If the `comment` object doesn't have an `id` property, you can use any other unique identifier, such as its index in the `comments` array:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
``` 

Using the index as the key is not recommended if the order of the items in the list can change, as it can cause performance issues and unexpected behavior.
