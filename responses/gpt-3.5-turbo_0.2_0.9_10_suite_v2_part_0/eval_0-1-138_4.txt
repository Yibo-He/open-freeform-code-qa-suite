Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode using CSS media queries. Here is an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}
```

This media query checks if the user's system has a preference for dark color schemes. If it does, the styles inside the media query will be applied.

You can also use JavaScript to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode. Here is an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // user is in dark mode
} else {
  // user is not in dark mode
}
```

This code checks if the user's system has a preference for dark color schemes using the `matchMedia` method. If it does, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed.

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, so you may need to use a polyfill or fallback styles for older browsers.
