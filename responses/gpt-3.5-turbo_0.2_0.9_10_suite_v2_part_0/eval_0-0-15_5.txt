To mock the `API` class correctly, you need to return a constructor function that returns an object with the mocked methods. Here's the revised version of the code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

This will create a mock constructor function that returns an object with the `someMethod` method mocked using `jest.fn()`. When you create a new instance of `API`, it will use this mock constructor function instead of the real one, and you can test that the `someMethod` method is called correctly.
