The code you provided looks correct. However, if the user denies the location permission, the `else` block will not be executed. Instead, an error will be thrown. To handle this error, you can add a second parameter to the `getCurrentPosition` method, which is a function that will be called if an error occurs. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
        console.log("Location accessed");
    }, error => {
        console.log("User not allowed");
    });
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

This code will log "Location accessed" if the user grants permission, "User not allowed" if the user denies permission, and "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." if the browser does not support geolocation.
