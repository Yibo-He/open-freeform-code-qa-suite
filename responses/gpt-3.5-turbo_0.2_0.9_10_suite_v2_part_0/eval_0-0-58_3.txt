The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of the installed package fails. This error can be caused by various reasons, such as network issues, corrupted cache, or outdated npm version.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and try installing the package again.

2. Upgrade npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm`.

3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

4. If you are using a private registry, check if the package is available and accessible.

5. Check your network connection and try again.

6. If none of the above works, try deleting the `~/.npm` folder and run `npm install` again.

7. If the issue persists, try using `yarn` instead of `npm` to install the package.
