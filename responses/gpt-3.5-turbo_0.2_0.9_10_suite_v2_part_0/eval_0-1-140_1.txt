With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. You need to use the `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on the version you are using. Also, the icon content is now specified using the `::before` pseudo-element instead of `::after`. Here's the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse::before {
  float: right;
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  content: "\f107";
}
```

Note that you may need to adjust the font-family name depending on the version and type of Font Awesome you are using.
