- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image clickable.
- Pressable has some new props, like `android_ripple` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.
- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

In general, if you need a simple clickable element, either Pressable or TouchableOpacity will work. However, if you need more control over the touch feedback, such as customizing the ripple effect or adding a different animation, then Pressable might be a better choice. Additionally, if you need to handle long press events, only Pressable supports this functionality.
