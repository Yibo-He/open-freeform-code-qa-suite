Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location permission, the `getCurrentPosition` function will not execute the success callback and will instead execute the error callback. Therefore, you need to add an error callback to handle the case where the user denies the location permission. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
``` 

This code will log "Location accessed" if the user allows the location permission, and "User not allowed" if the user denies the location permission. If the browser does not support geolocation, it will log "Geolocation is not supported by this browser."
