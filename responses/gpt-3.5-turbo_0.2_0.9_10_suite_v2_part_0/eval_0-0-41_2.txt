The code you provided looks correct. However, it is possible that the user has denied permission to access their location. In this case, the `getCurrentPosition` method will fail silently and the `else` block will not be executed.

To handle this case, you can add an error callback function to the `getCurrentPosition` method. Here's an updated code snippet:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user denies permission to access their location, the error callback function will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
