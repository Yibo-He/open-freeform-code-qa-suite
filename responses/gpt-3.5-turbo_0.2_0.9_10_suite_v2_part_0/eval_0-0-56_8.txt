It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file to:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the container.

Also, make sure that you are running the Vite server with the correct command inside the Docker container. You should use the `npm run vite` command instead of `npm run dev` which is for Vue CLI.

Once you have made these changes, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again. You should now be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
