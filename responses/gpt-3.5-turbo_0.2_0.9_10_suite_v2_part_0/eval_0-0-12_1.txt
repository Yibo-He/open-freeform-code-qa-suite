The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you provided are not accepted by Gmail. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" and then turn on "Less secure app access".

2. If you have enabled two-factor authentication for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app password to use instead of your regular password. To generate an app password, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" and then click on "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use that instead of your regular password in your code.

3. If none of the above solutions work, you can try using OAuth2 authentication instead of username and password authentication. You can find more information on how to do this in the Nodemailer documentation.
