It seems that the issue is related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will make it listen on all available network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file like this:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the container.

Also, make sure that the Docker container is running and that the port is correctly mapped. You can check this by running `docker ps` and looking for the container that is running your app. The output should show that the container is listening on port `8080`.

If you still can't access the Vite server from outside the container, you may need to check your firewall settings to make sure that the port is not blocked.
