Sure! The error message "Error: req#logout requires a callback function" indicates that the `req.logout()` method requires a callback function as a parameter. You can modify your code as follows to resolve the issue:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    req.session.destroy((err) => {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

In the modified code, we are using the `req.session.destroy()` method to destroy the session and remove the session data. This method also requires a callback function as a parameter. Once the session is destroyed, we are redirecting the user to the home page ("/").
