If you are receiving a 404 error when deploying your NextJS app to Vercel, it is likely that the issue is related to your routing configuration. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your `package.json` file to ensure that your `start` script is set to `next start`. This is the command that Vercel will use to start your app.

2. Check your `pages` directory to ensure that all of your pages are named correctly and are in the correct location. For example, if you have a page at `/pages/about.js`, make sure that the file is named `about.js` and is located in the `pages` directory.

3. Check your dynamic routes to ensure that they are set up correctly. Dynamic routes in NextJS are defined using square brackets, like this: `/pages/posts/[id].js`. Make sure that your dynamic routes are set up correctly and that any necessary parameters are being passed correctly.

4. If you are using any custom server-side code, make sure that it is compatible with Vercel's serverless architecture. Vercel does not support custom server-side code that requires a dedicated server.

5. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, try creating a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project and adding the following code:

```
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
};
```

This will ensure that your app is built with Vercel's serverless architecture in mind.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
