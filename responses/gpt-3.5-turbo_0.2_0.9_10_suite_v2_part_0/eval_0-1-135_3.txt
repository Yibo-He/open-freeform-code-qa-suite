Try adding `align-items: flex-start;` to the `.container` class. This will ensure that the images are aligned to the top of their respective flex containers and prevent them from being stretched. Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

This should fix the issue in Safari.
