Sure! Here's the revised route pattern that should work for your requirements:

```
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?
```

This pattern will match the following URLs:

- `/route/aa/config`
- `/route/aa/config/bb`
- `/route/aa/config/bb/cc`

Note that the second optional parameter is named `OptionalParam3`, which is a typo in your original question. I assumed you meant to name it `OptionalParam2` instead.
