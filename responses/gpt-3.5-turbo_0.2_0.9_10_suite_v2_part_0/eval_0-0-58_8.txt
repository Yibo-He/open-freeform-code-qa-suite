The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error usually occurs when the integrity check of the package fails. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the cache: Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache and try running `npm install` again.

2. Update npm: Update npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm`.

3. Delete `node_modules` folder: Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again.

4. Use `--no-optional` flag: Run `npm install --no-optional` to skip installing optional dependencies.

5. Use `--ignore-scripts` flag: Run `npm install --ignore-scripts` to skip running scripts during installation.

6. Use `--force` flag: Run `npm install --force` to force installation even if the integrity check fails.

7. Check your network connection: Sometimes the error can be caused by a poor network connection. Check your network connection and try again.

If none of these measures work, you can try deleting the `package-lock.json` file and running `npm install` again. If the issue persists, you may need to contact the package maintainer for further assistance.
