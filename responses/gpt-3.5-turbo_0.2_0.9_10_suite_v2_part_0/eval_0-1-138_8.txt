Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode on macOS using CSS media queries. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for dark mode */
}
```

This media query checks if the user's system is in Dark Mode and applies the styles inside the curly braces accordingly. You can use this media query to change the design of your site to be more friendly for Dark Mode users.

Note that this media query is supported in Safari 12.1+ and Firefox 67+. Chrome does not currently support this media query, but you can use JavaScript to detect the user's system preference and apply styles accordingly. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // User is in Dark Mode
  // Apply dark mode styles
} else {
  // User is not in Dark Mode
  // Apply light mode styles
}
```

This JavaScript code checks if the user's system is in Dark Mode using the `matchMedia` method and applies the appropriate styles based on the result.
