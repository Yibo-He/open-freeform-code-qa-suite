To remove a package added using `ng add`, you can use the `npm uninstall` command. 

First, navigate to the root directory of your Angular project in the terminal. Then, run the following command:

```
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove. For example, if you want to remove the `@angular/material` package, you would run:

```
npm uninstall @angular/material
```

After running this command, the package will be removed from your project and its dependencies will be updated accordingly.
