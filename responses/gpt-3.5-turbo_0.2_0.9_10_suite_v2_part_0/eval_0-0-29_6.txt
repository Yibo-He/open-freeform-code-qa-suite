To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const [userId, setUserId] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    setUserId(user.id);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user.id]);

const { data: userBio } = useGetUserBioQuery(userId);
```

This code uses the `useState` hook to store the `userId` parameter for the second query. The `useEffect` hook watches for changes in the `userFulfilled` and `user.id` variables. When `userFulfilled` becomes `true`, the `userId` state is updated with the `id` from the `user` object. Finally, the second query is executed with the `userId` parameter.
