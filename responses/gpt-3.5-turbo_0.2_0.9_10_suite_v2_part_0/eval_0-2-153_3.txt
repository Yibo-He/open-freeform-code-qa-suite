You can use the `border-t` class instead of `border` to apply the border only to the top of the element. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900 border-t-1">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border of width 1 pixel and color blue-900 only to the top of the element. You can adjust the width and color as needed.
