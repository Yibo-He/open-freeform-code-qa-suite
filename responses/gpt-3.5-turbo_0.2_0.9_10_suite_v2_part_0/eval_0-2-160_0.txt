When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, making it easier to debug and trace errors in your code. When you have `"sourceMap": true`, the TypeScript compiler generates a `.js.map` file for each `.js` file it generates.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the generated JavaScript code will not have a corresponding source map file. This means that if you encounter an error in your JavaScript code, you will not be able to trace it back to the original TypeScript code.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can also have some benefits. It can reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files, as source map files can be quite large. It can also improve the performance of your application, as the browser does not need to download and parse the source map files.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits, but it can also make it harder to debug errors in your code. It's up to you to decide whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for your particular project.
