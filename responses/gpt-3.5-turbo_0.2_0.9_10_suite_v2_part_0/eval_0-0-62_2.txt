The error message is indicating that you are using a non-primitive value as a key in your `v-for` directive. In your case, you are using the entire `comment` object as the key, which is not recommended.

To fix this, you should use a unique identifier from the `comment` object as the key. For example, if `comment` has an `id` property, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If `comment` doesn't have a unique identifier, you can use the index of the comment in the `comments` array as the key:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Using the index as the key is not ideal, but it's better than using the entire object as the key.
