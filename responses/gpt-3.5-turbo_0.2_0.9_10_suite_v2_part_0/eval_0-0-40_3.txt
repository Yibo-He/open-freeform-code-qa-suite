It seems like there is an issue with the line endings in the npm executable file. You can try the following steps to fix this issue:

1. Open the file `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm` in a text editor.
2. Convert the line endings from Windows (CRLF) to Unix (LF). You can do this using the `dos2unix` command. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the command `sudo apt-get install dos2unix`.
   ```
   dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
   ```
3. Make the file executable using the command `sudo chmod +x /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm`.
4. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

If the above steps don't work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Node.js and npm using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
``` 

This should install the latest version of Node.js and npm and fix any issues with the installation.
