It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API endpoint that is not working properly. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is not responding, which is causing the `useQuery` hook to hang at the `loading` state.

To fix this issue, you need to use a valid GraphQL API endpoint that responds to your queries. You can try using a different endpoint, such as the one provided by the Apollo Client documentation:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

This should allow you to fetch data successfully using the `useQuery` hook.
