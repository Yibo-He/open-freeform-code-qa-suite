Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this effect. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-2' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the above code, we're using the `pb-2` class to add a bottom padding to all `li` elements except the last one. We're using a ternary operator to conditionally apply this class based on the index of the current item. If the current item is the last one, we don't apply any padding.

Note that we're also using string interpolation to dynamically generate the `key` attribute for each `li` element. This is a best practice when using `v-for` in Vue.js.
