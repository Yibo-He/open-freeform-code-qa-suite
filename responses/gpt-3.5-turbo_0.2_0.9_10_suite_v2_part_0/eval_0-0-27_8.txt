It seems like the issue is with the URI you are using in your `ApolloClient`. The URI `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` is a demo server provided by Apollo Client, and it may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the URI with the endpoint of your GraphQL server. For example, if you are using a local server, you can use `http://localhost:4000/graphql` as the URI. If you are using a remote server, you should use the URL provided by your hosting service.

Once you have updated the URI, try running your app again and see if it works.
