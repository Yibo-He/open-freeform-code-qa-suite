The error message you are getting suggests that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail are not being accepted. Here are some steps you can take to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, clicking on "Security", and then scrolling down to "Less secure app access". Turn this option on.

2. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app password to use instead of your regular password. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, clicking on "Security", and then scrolling down to "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use that instead of your regular password in your code.

3. Double-check that you are using the correct username and password in your code. Make sure that there are no typos or mistakes in the email address or password.

4. If none of the above steps work, try using a different email service provider or SMTP server to send your emails. Some email providers may block access from certain IP addresses or may have other restrictions in place that prevent you from sending emails.
