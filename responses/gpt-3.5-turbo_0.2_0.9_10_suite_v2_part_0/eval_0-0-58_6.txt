The `EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of a package fails. This error can be caused by various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or a mismatch between the expected and actual checksum.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and try installing the package again.
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
3. Upgrade to the latest version of npm by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and try installing the package again.
4. If you are using a private registry, check if the registry is up and running and try again.
5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and the `npm` folder in your home directory (`~/.npm`), then run `npm install` again.

Hopefully, one of these measures will resolve the issue for you.
