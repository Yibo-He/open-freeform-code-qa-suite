Sure, you can use the `group-hover` variant in Tailwind to achieve this effect. Here's an example code snippet:

```html
<a href="#" class="group inline-block text-sky-600 relative">
  Link
  <span class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition duration-500 transform origin-left scale-x-0 group-hover:scale-x-100"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we're using the `group` class to apply styles to both the link and the span element inside it. We're also using the `group-hover` variant to apply styles to the span element only when the link is being hovered over.

The `relative` class is used on the link element to make the span element position itself relative to the link. The `absolute` class is used on the span element to position it at the bottom of the link.

The `transform` property is used to scale the span element horizontally from 0 to 100% when the link is being hovered over. The `origin-left` property is used to make the scaling start from the left side of the span element.

The `transition` property is used to animate the scaling effect over a duration of 500ms.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
