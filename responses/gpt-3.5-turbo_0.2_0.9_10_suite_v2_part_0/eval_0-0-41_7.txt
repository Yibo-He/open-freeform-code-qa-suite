Your code looks correct, but you may need to handle the case where the user denies permission to access their location. Here's a revised version of your code that should work:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User denied location access");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this revised version, we added a second argument to `getCurrentPosition()` which is a function that gets called if the user denies permission to access their location.
