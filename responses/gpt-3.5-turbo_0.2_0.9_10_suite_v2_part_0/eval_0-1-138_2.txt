Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox by checking the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. This media query allows you to detect whether the user has set their system to use a light or dark color scheme.

Here's an example of how to use it in CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for dark mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* Styles for light mode */
}
```

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's system color scheme:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // User is in dark mode
} else {
  // User is in light mode
}
```

Note that this feature is only available in modern browsers, so you may need to provide fallback styles for older browsers that don't support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.
