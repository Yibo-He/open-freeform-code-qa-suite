It looks like you're missing a comma after the value of the "primary" color in your `$theme-colors` map. Try adding a comma after the color value like this:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
);
```

Also, make sure that you're importing the correct Bootstrap variables file. In your example, you're importing `../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables`, which is the correct path for Bootstrap 5.1.0. However, if you're using an older version of Bootstrap, the path may be different.
