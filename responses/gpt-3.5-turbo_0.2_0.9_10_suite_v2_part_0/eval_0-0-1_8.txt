It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic routes in your NextJS app. When deploying to Vercel, you need to make sure that your dynamic routes are properly configured.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your Vercel deployment logs for any errors or warnings. This can give you a clue as to what might be causing the issue.

2. Make sure that your dynamic routes are properly defined in your NextJS app. You can do this by creating a `pages` directory and adding a file with square brackets in the filename (e.g. `[id].js` for a dynamic route with an `id` parameter).

3. If you're using dynamic routes with API routes, make sure that your API routes are properly configured. You can do this by creating a `pages/api` directory and adding a file with the same name as your dynamic route (e.g. `pages/api/[id].js` for a dynamic route with an `id` parameter).

4. If you're using dynamic routes with static content, make sure that your static content is properly generated. You can do this by using the `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` functions in your dynamic route file.

5. If you're still having issues, you can try adding a `next.config.js` file to your project and configuring your dynamic routes there. Here's an example configuration:

```
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog/:slug',
        destination: '/blog/post/:slug',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

This configuration maps the dynamic route `/blog/:slug` to the static route `/blog/post/:slug`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
