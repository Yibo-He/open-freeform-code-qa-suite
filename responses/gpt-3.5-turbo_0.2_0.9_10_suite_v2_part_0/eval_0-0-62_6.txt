The error message is indicating that you are using a non-primitive value as the key in your `v-for` loop. In this case, you are using the entire `comment` object as the key, which is not recommended. 

To fix this, you should use a unique identifier for each comment as the key. For example, if each comment has a unique `id` property, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

Alternatively, you can use the index of the comment in the array as the key, but this is not recommended if the order of the comments can change:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```
