It looks like there might be an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. You can try fixing it by running the following command:

```
sudo sed -i 's/\r//' /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This command will remove any carriage return characters from the `npm` file, which should fix the issue with the bad interpreter error.

After running this command, try running `npm -v` again and see if it works.
