When deploying a NextJS app to Vercel, there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

1. Make sure you have a `vercel.json` file in the root of your project. This file tells Vercel how to build and deploy your app. Here's an example:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": ".next/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Make sure you have the correct `start` script in your `package.json` file. It should be `"start": "next start -p $PORT"`.

3. If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using the correct file naming convention. For example, if you have a dynamic route called `pages/posts/[id].js`, make sure the file name is exactly `[id].js`, with the square brackets included.

4. If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using the correct link component to navigate to them. Use `Link` from `next/link` instead of `a` tags.

5. If you're using environment variables, make sure you add them to Vercel's environment variables in the dashboard.

If you've checked all of these things and you're still having issues, try running `vercel logs` in your terminal to see if there are any errors in the deployment logs.
