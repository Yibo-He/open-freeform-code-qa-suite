If you are receiving a 404 error when deploying your NextJS app to Vercel, it is likely that the issue is related to the routing configuration. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your `package.json` file to ensure that the `start` script is set to `next start`. This is the command that Vercel will use to start your app.

2. Check your `pages` directory to ensure that all of your pages are named correctly and are in the correct location. For example, if you have a page called `about.js`, it should be located in the `pages` directory at `pages/about.js`.

3. Check your dynamic routes to ensure that they are set up correctly. Dynamic routes in NextJS are defined using square brackets, like this: `[id].js`. Make sure that your dynamic route files are named correctly and are located in the `pages` directory.

4. If you are using any custom server-side code, make sure that it is compatible with Vercel's deployment environment. Vercel uses a serverless architecture, so any server-side code must be written in a way that is compatible with this architecture.

5. If you are still having issues, try creating a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project and adding the following code:

```
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

This will ensure that your app is built in a way that is compatible with Vercel's deployment environment.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
