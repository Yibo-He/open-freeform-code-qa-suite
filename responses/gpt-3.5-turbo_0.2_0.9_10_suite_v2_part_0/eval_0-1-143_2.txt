You can modify the `browser.css` file in Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here's how:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:profiles` in the address bar and looking for the "Root Directory" entry.
4. In your profile folder, create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open `userChrome.css` in a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
menupopup > menuitem {
  padding-top: 4px !important;
  padding-bottom: 4px !important;
}
```

7. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code reduces the top and bottom padding of menu items to 4 pixels, which should reduce the spacing between them. You can adjust the pixel values to your liking. Note that modifying Firefox's internal CSS files can cause issues with future updates, so be sure to keep an eye on any changes to the browser's interface.
