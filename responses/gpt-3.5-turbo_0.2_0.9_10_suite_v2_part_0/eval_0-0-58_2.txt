The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of the downloaded package fails. This error can be resolved by trying the following measures:

1. Clearing the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then running `npm install` again.
2. Updating npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then running `npm install` again.
3. Deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm install` again.
4. Checking if the package version specified in `package.json` is correct and matches the version available in the registry.
5. Checking if there are any network issues or firewalls that may be blocking the download of the package.
6. If none of the above measures work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm cache clean --force` before running `npm install` again.

If none of these measures work, you can try deleting the entire `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm install` again.
