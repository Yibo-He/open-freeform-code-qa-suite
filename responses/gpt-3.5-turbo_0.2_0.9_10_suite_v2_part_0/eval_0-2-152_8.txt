To show the toast, you need to call the `toast()` method on the `.toast` element. Here's the updated Javascript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default animation. If you want to customize the animation, you can pass an options object to the `toast()` method. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  animation: true,
  delay: 2000
}).toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with a 2-second delay and a fade animation. You can find more information about customizing the toast options in the Bootstrap documentation.
