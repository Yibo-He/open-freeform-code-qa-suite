To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Here's how you can modify the second query code:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user?.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // Only run the second query if the first one is fulfilled and user.id exists
    if (user?.id) {
      userBioRefetch();
    }
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user?.id]);
```

In this code, we're using the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` and `user?.id` variables. If `userFulfilled` is true and `user?.id` exists, we call the `userBioRefetch` function to run the second query with the `user.id` parameter. Note that we're using the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to check if `user.id` exists before running the second query.
