The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works on block-level elements. In your code, the `span` element is an inline-level element. To make it work, you can add the `block` class to the `span` element:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold block truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will make the `span` element a block-level element and the `truncate` class will work as expected.
