The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, but the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. You can do this by updating the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`, like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json",
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

This assumes that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it's located elsewhere, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly.

Once you've made this change, save the `.eslintrc.js` file and restart VSCode. The error message should disappear, and you should no longer see red squiggly lines in your `.ts` files.
