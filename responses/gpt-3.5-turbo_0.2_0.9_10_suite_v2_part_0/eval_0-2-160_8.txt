When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your application. 

Source maps are used to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to set breakpoints and step through your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your application, as the browser does not need to download the source map files. This can be particularly useful if you are deploying your application to a production environment where performance is critical.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` will disable source map generation, which can improve performance but will make it more difficult to debug your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.
