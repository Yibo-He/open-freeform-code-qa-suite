When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, which is useful for debugging purposes.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the generated JavaScript code will not have a corresponding source map file. This means that when you debug your application in the browser, you will not be able to see the original TypeScript code in the debugger. Instead, you will only see the compiled JavaScript code.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your application, as generating source maps can be a time-consuming process. Additionally, if you are not planning to debug your application in the browser, you may not need source maps at all.

It's worth noting that if you are using a tool like `webpack` or `rollup` to bundle your application, you may need to configure those tools to generate source maps separately, even if you have set `"sourceMap": false" in your `tsconfig.json` file.
