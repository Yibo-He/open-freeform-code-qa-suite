You can use the `group-hover` variant in Tailwind CSS to achieve this effect. Here's an example code snippet:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300 relative">
    Link
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 left-0"></span>
    <span class="block max-w-full duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 left-0 group-hover:max-w-0"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we have added an extra `span` element with a `max-width` of `0` and a `duration` of `500ms` to create the animation effect. We have also added the `group` class to the parent `a` element to enable the `group-hover` variant.

The `absolute` class is used to position the `span` elements at the bottom of the `a` element. The `bottom-0` and `left-0` classes are used to position the `span` elements at the bottom left corner of the `a` element.

The `group-hover:max-w-0` class is used to animate the `max-width` of the second `span` element to `0` when the `a` element is hovered over.

You can adjust the `duration` and `background-color` values to suit your needs.
