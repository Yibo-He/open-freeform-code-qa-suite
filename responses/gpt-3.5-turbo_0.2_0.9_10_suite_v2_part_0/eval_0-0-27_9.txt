It seems like the issue is with the `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient`. The `uri` you are using is a demo server provided by Apollo Client, which may not be working properly at the moment. 

You should replace the `uri` with the actual GraphQL endpoint of your server. You can check with your backend team to get the correct `uri`. 

For example, if you are using a local server, you can replace the `uri` with `http://localhost:4000/graphql` (assuming your server is running on port 4000). 

Once you have updated the `uri`, try running the app again and see if it works.
