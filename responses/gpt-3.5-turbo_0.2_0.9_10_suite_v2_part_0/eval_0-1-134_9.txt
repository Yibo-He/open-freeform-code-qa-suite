It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin for text editors that allows you to write HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently. 

To use Emmet, you can type a shorthand code and then press the "Tab" key to expand it into the full HTML or CSS code. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing "Tab" should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your text editor. The specific steps to do this will depend on your editor, but you can usually find instructions by searching for "install Emmet in [your editor name]". 

Additionally, make sure that you are typing the shorthand code correctly. Emmet has a specific syntax that you need to follow in order for it to work. For example, to create a div with a class, you need to start with a period followed by the class name (e.g. `.classname`), not just the class name on its own.
