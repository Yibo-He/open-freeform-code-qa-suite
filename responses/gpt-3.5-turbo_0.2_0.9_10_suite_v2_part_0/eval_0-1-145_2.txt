The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width or a max-width set. You can try adding `max-w-xs` or `max-w-sm` class to the `span` element to limit its width and make the `truncate` class work.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate max-w-xs">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

You can adjust the `max-w-xs` value to fit your needs.
