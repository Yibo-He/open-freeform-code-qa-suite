It seems like there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. You can try running the following command to fix it:

```
sudo sed -i 's/\r//' /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This command will remove the carriage return character (`\r`) from the `npm` file.

After running this command, try running `npm -v` again and see if it works.
