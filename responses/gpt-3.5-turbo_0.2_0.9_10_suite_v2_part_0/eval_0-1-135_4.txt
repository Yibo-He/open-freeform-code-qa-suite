One possible solution is to add `align-items: flex-start;` to the `.container` class. This will prevent Safari from stretching the nested flexbox element and allow the `height: auto;` property to work as expected. Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

This should ensure that the images are not stretched and maintain their aspect ratio.
