To improve the efficiency and follow best practices, you should move the styled component outside of the functional component. This way, the styled component is only created once and not every time the functional component is rendered. Here's the refactored code:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper isSelected={isSelected} onClick={onClick}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
``` 

In the refactored code, the `TabWrapper` is defined outside of the functional component and is passed the `isSelected` prop. This prop is used to conditionally style the component.
