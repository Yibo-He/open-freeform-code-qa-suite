To move the stop button to the top and align it with the begin button, you can add the following CSS code to your `style.css` file:

```css
#GameStopped {
  position: relative;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

This will make the `#GameStopped` div position relative, and the `#StopBtn` button position absolute. The `top: 0` and `left: 0` properties will move the button to the top left corner of the `#GameStopped` div. You can adjust the `top` and `left` values to fine-tune the position of the button.
