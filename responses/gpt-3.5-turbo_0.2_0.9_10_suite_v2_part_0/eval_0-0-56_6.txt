It seems that the issue is related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself.

To fix this issue, you need to tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. This will allow Vite to be accessed from outside the container.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

With this configuration, Vite will bind to `0.0.0.0` which means that it can be accessed from outside the container.

After making this change, you should be able to access Vite from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
