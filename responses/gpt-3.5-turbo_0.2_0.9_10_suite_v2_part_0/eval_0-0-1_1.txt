It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic route, but it's difficult to say for sure without more information. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your Vercel logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, it should give you a URL to view the logs. Check the logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might be causing the issue.

2. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that your `start` script is set to `next start`. If it's not, Vercel might not be able to start your app correctly.

3. Create a `next.config.js` file: Even if you don't have any custom configuration options, creating a `next.config.js` file might help. Here's an example of a basic `next.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

This tells Next.js to use the serverless target, which is required for some Vercel deployments.

4. Check your dynamic route: If you're using a dynamic route, make sure that it's set up correctly. Here's an example of a dynamic route in Next.js:

```
// pages/posts/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Post() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { id } = router.query

  return <p>Post: {id}</p>
}
```

Make sure that your dynamic route is set up correctly and that you're using the `useRouter` hook to get the dynamic parameter.

5. Check your file names: Make sure that your file names match the case of the URLs you're trying to access. For example, if you have a file called `About.js`, make sure that you're accessing it at `/about` (not `/About` or `/about.js`).

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you fix the issue!
