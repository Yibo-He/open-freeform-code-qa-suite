Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17. However, you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a community-supported adapter for React 17.

To use it, first install the package:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, update your Enzyme configuration to use the new adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

With this configuration, you should be able to write unit tests for your React 17 app using Enzyme.
