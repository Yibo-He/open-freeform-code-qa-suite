To improve the efficiency and follow best practices, you should move the styled component outside of the functional component. This way, the styled component is only created once and not every time the functional component is rendered. Here's the refactored code:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
``` 

Note that I also changed the `color` and `background-color` properties to use `props.isSelected` instead of `isSelected` directly, since we're passing it as a prop to the styled component.
