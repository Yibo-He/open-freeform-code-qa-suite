It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write shorthand code that expands into HTML and CSS. 

To use Emmet, you can type out the shorthand code and then press the "Tab" key. For example, if you type `.classname` and then press "Tab", it should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The specific steps to do this will depend on your editor, so you may need to refer to the documentation or do a quick Google search to figure out how to enable Emmet.

Also, keep in mind that Emmet has its own syntax and rules, so it may take some time to get used to it. But once you do, it can save you a lot of time and typing!
