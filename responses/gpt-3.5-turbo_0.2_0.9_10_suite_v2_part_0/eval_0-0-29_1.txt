To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Once it becomes true, you can then run the second query with the `user.id` parameter.

Here's the code for the second query:

```javascript
const [userBio, setUserBio] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled && user) {
    const { data } = await useGetUserBioQuery(user.id).unwrap();
    setUserBio(data);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user]);
```

This code uses the `useState` hook to store the result of the second query. The `useEffect` hook watches for changes in the `userFulfilled` and `user` variables. Once both are true and not null, it runs the second query with the `user.id` parameter using the `useGetUserBioQuery` hook. The `unwrap` method is used to extract the data from the query result. Finally, the result is stored in the `userBio` state variable using the `setUserBio` function.
