Sure! You can add an event listener to the editor instance to listen for the "keydown" event and check if the "Enter" key was pressed. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });
  editor.on('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      console.log('good');
      // submit chat and clear editor here
    }
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

This code adds an event listener to the editor instance that listens for the "keydown" event. When the event is triggered, it checks if the key that was pressed was the "Enter" key. If it was, it logs "good" to the console. You can replace the `console.log('good')` line with your own code to submit the chat and clear the editor.
