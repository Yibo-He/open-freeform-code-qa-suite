This error message indicates that the integrity check of the package failed. This can happen due to various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or even a compromised package.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and try running `npm install` again.

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

3. Upgrade your npm version to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm`.

4. If you are using a private registry, try running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` to switch to the public registry.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and the `npm` folder in your home directory (`~/.npm`), then run `npm install` again.

6. If the issue persists, try using `yarn` instead of `npm` as it has a more robust package integrity check mechanism.

7. If you suspect that the package may be compromised, report it to the package maintainer and avoid using it until the issue is resolved.
