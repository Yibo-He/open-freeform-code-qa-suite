TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select elements using CSS selectors like `div.section > div`.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in TailwindCSS to define your own custom CSS rules. Here's an example of how you can define a custom rule to select direct children of `div` elements with the class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  div.section > div {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

You can place this code in your `tailwind.config.js` file, inside the `theme` object. This will create a new layer called `components` and add your custom rule to it.

Then, you can use the `@apply` directive in your HTML to apply the custom rule:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="my-custom-class @apply components-div">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, `my-custom-class` is your own custom class, and `components-div` is the class name of the custom rule you defined earlier. The `@apply` directive tells TailwindCSS to apply the styles defined in the `components-div` rule to the element.
