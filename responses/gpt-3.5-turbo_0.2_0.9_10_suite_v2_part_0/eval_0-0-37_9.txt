Sure, here's the revised route pattern that should fulfill your requirement:

```
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?
```

This pattern has two optional parameters, `OptionalParam2` and `OptionalParam3`, which are denoted by the question mark `?` at the end of their respective segments. This means that they can be present in the URL, but they don't have to be.

So, the route will match any of the following URLs:

- `/route/aa/config`
- `/route/aa/config/bb`
- `/route/aa/config/bb/cc`

The `:param1`, `:OptionalParam2`, and `:OptionalParam3` segments are placeholders for actual values that will be passed to your Nestjs controller method. You can access these values using the `@Param()` decorator in your controller method.
