The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password provided in the code are not being accepted by the Gmail server. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the Gmail account you are using to send emails is configured to allow less secure apps. You can check this by going to your Google Account settings and enabling "Allow less secure apps". 

2. If you have enabled two-factor authentication for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app password to use instead of your regular password. You can generate an app password by going to your Google Account settings and selecting "Security", then "App passwords". 

3. If you are still having issues, you can try using an application-specific password instead of your regular Gmail password. To do this, go to your Google Account settings and select "Security", then "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use that in your code instead of your regular password.

Once you have made the necessary changes, try running the code again and see if the issue is resolved.
