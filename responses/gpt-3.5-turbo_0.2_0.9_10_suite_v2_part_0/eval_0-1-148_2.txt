Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-2' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the above code, we are using the ternary operator to conditionally add the `pb-2` class to all `li` elements except the last one. `pb-2` adds a padding-bottom of 0.5rem, which creates the space between the `li` elements.

Note that we are also using string interpolation to dynamically generate the `key` attribute for each `li` element.
