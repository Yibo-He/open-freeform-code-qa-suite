The error message you are getting indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail are not being accepted. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to the "Less secure app access" section. Turn this option on.

2. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an "App password" to use instead of your regular Gmail password. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to the "App passwords" section. Generate a new app password and use this instead of your regular Gmail password in your code.

3. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "Display Unlock Captcha" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to the "Third-party apps with account access" section. Click on "Manage third-party access" and then click on "Turn on access" next to "Display Unlock Captcha". This will allow your code to access your Gmail account.

Once you have tried these solutions, try running your code again and see if the error persists.
