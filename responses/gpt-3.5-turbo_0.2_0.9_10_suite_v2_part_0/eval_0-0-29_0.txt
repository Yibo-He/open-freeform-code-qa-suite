To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook and add `user.id` as a dependency. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // First query is fulfilled, so we can run the second query
    userBioFulfilled || refetch(); // refetch() is optional, it will re-run the query if it's not already fulfilled
  }
}, [user.id, userFulfilled, userBioFulfilled]);
```

This code will run the second query only after the first one is fulfilled and `user.id` is available. The `useEffect` hook will watch for changes in `user.id`, `userFulfilled`, and `userBioFulfilled`. If `userFulfilled` is true, it will check if `userBioFulfilled` is also true. If it's not, it will run `refetch()` to fetch the data.
