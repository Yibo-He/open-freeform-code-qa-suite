You can modify the `browser.css` file in Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for the "Profile Folder" entry.
4. In your profile folder, create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file in a text editor.
7. Add the following code to the file:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .panel-subview-body {
  padding-block: 0px !important;
}
```

8. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code targets the menu panel in Firefox and sets the padding between menu items to 0 pixels. You can adjust the value to your liking if you want more or less spacing.
