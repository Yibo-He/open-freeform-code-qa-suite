Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location access, the `getCurrentPosition` method will not execute the success callback function and will instead execute the error callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle the case where the user denies the location access. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this revised code, if the user denies the location access, the error callback function will execute and log "User not allowed" to the console.
