It seems like the issue is with the way you are starting the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to be accessed from any IP address.

To do this, you need to modify your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will bind the Vite server to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to be accessed from outside the container.

Once you have made this change, you can start the Vite server inside the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
npm run vite --host 0.0.0.0
```

This will start the Vite server and bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to be accessed from outside the container.

After making these changes, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
