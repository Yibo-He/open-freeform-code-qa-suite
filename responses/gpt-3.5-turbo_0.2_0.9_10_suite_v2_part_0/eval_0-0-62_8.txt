The error is caused by using a non-primitive value as the key in the `v-for` loop. In your case, you are using the entire `comment` object as the key, which is not recommended. 

To fix the error, you can use a unique identifier from the `comment` object as the key. For example, if `comment.id` is a unique identifier for each comment, you can use it as the key like this:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

This will ensure that each comment is uniquely identified and prevent the warning message from appearing.
