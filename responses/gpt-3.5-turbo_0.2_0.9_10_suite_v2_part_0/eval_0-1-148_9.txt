Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-2' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the above code, we are using the ternary operator to conditionally add the `pb-2` (padding-bottom) class to all the `li` elements except the last one. The `pb-2` class will add a padding-bottom of 0.5rem to the `li` element. 

We are also using the `{{ }}` syntax to interpolate the class name based on the index of the current item in the loop. If the index is equal to the length of the `items` array minus 1 (i.e., the last item), we don't add any additional classes. Otherwise, we add the `pb-2` class to create the desired style.
