Enzyme has not yet released an adapter for React 17, but there is a community-supported adapter called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` that you can use. Here is how you can adapt the code snippet you provided to work with React 17 using this adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Make sure to install the adapter first by running `npm install @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. With this adapter, you should be able to write unit tests for your React 17 app using Enzyme.
