The error log indicates that node-gyp is unable to find Python executable "python" or "python2" in the PATH. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. 

Here are the steps to install Python and add it to the PATH:

1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run the installer and select "Add Python to PATH" option during the installation process.
3. After installation, open the Command Prompt and type `python` to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH.
4. If Python is not added to the PATH, you can add it manually by following these steps:
   - Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
   - Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - Under "System Variables", scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click on "Edit".
   - Click on "New" and add the path to the Python executable (e.g. C:\Python27) and click "OK".
   - Restart your Command Prompt and try running the build again.

Once you have installed Python and added it to the PATH, try running the build again and it should work.
