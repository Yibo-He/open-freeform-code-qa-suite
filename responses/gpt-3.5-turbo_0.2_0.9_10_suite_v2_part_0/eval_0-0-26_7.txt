Yes, you can add a displayName to the functional component that is being used in the render function. Here's an example:

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: function RenderText(text) {
        return <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;
      },
    }
  ];

RenderText.displayName = 'RenderText';
```

By adding the displayName property to the function, you are giving it a name that ESLint can recognize. In this case, I've named it "RenderText", but you can choose any name that makes sense for your code.
