You need to use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast message when the page loads. If you want to show the toast message on a specific event, such as a button click, you can add an event listener and call the `.toast('show')` method inside it. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast message when the button with the ID `myButton` is clicked.
