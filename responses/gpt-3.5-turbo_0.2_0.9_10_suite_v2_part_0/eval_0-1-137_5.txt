It looks like you are missing a comma after the value of the "primary" color in your `$theme-colors` map. Try adding a comma after the color value like this:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
);
```

Also, make sure that you are using valid CSS color values in your map. If you are using a color variable or function, make sure to evaluate it to a color value before adding it to the map. For example:

```scss
$my-color: #ff0000;
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": $my-color,
);
```

If you still encounter issues, try updating your SASS version to the latest version (currently 1.37.5) and recompiling your SCSS file.
