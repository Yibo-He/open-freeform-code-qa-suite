This error occurs because Bootstrap requires the Popper.js library as a dependency. To fix this error, you need to install the Popper.js library using npm. 

To install Popper.js, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install popper.js --save
```

This will install the Popper.js library and save it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your JavaScript file before importing Bootstrap. Here's an example:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import $ from 'jquery';
import 'bootstrap';
```

Make sure to import Popper.js before importing Bootstrap. This should resolve the "Module not found: can't resolve popper.js" error.
