With Font Awesome 5, the syntax has changed slightly. You need to use the `font-family` property with the value `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Brands"` depending on the type of icon you want to use. You also need to use the `::before` pseudo-element instead of `::after`. Here is the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse::after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project and that the font files are in the correct location.
