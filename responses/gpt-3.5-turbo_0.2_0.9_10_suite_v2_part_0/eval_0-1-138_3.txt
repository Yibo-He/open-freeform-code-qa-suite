Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox by checking the value of the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. 

Here's an example of how to check for Dark Mode in CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}
```

And here's an example of how to check for Dark Mode in JavaScript:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // user is in dark mode
} else {
  // user is in light mode
}
```

You can use these media queries to change your site's design to be dark-mode friendly based on the current operating mode.
