You can change the color of the accordion arrow by adding custom CSS to your code. Here's an example:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS rule targets the pseudo-element `::after` of the `.accordion-button` class when it is not collapsed. The `color` property is set to green, which changes the color of the arrow.

You can add this CSS code to your HTML file by wrapping it in a `<style>` tag, like this:

```html
<style>
    .accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
        color: green;
    }
</style>
```

Alternatively, you can add this CSS code to an external stylesheet and link it to your HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
