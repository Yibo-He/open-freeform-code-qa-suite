To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the `npm uninstall` command. 

First, navigate to the root directory of your Angular project in the terminal or command prompt. Then, run the following command:

```
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove. This will remove the package from your project and also remove any configuration files or dependencies associated with it.

After uninstalling the package, you may also want to remove any references to it in your code, such as import statements or usage of its components or services.
