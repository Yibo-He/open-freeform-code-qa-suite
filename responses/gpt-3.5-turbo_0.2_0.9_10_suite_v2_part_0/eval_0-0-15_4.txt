To mock a class with Jest, you can use the `jest.mock` function and return a constructor function that creates an object with the same methods as the original class. Here's how you can revise the code to eliminate the error:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

In this code, we're using `jest.fn()` to create a mock constructor function that returns an object with a `someMethod` method. We're also using `mockImplementation` to provide a custom implementation for the constructor function. Finally, we're creating a new instance of the mocked `API` class with `const api = new API()`. This should eliminate the `TypeError` error.
