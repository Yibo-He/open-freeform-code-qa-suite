Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode using CSS media queries. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}
```

This media query checks if the user's system has a preference for a dark color scheme. If it does, the styles within the media query will be applied.

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's system color scheme preference and apply styles accordingly. Here's an example using the `matchMedia` method:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Styles for Dark Mode
}
```

This code checks if the user's system has a preference for a dark color scheme using the `matchMedia` method. If it does, the styles within the `if` statement will be applied.

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, so you may need to use a polyfill or fallback styles for older browsers.
