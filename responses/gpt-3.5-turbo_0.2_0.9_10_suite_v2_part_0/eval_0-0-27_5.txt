The issue might be related to the fact that the GraphQL server you are trying to query is not accessible from your React Native app. 

You are using the `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` endpoint, which is a public endpoint provided by Apollo Client for testing purposes. However, this endpoint might not be accessible from your local environment due to network restrictions.

To test if this is the issue, you can try using a different GraphQL endpoint that is accessible from your local environment. For example, you can use the GraphQL API provided by GitHub:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://api.github.com/graphql',
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`,
    },
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with a valid GitHub personal access token that has the `read:user` scope.

If this works, then the issue is related to the accessibility of the original GraphQL endpoint. You might need to configure your network settings or use a different endpoint that is accessible from your environment.
