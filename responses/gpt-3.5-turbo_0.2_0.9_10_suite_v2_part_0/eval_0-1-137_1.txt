The issue is with the format of the `$theme-colors` variable. The values in the map should be in quotes. Here's the corrected SCSS code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": "#0d6efd",
  "secondary": "#6c757d",
  "success": "#198754",
  "info": "#0dcaf0",
  "warning": "#ffc107",
  "danger": "#dc3545",
  "light": "#f8f9fa",
  "dark": "#212529"
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace the color values with your desired colors. This should compile without any errors.
