Yes, you can achieve this animation effect using Tailwind CSS. Here's an example code snippet that you can use:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 relative">
    Link
    <span class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:h-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we have added the `relative` class to the link container and `absolute` class to the span element. The `bottom-0` and `left-0` classes position the span element at the bottom of the link container. The `w-full` class makes the span element take up the full width of the link container.

We have also added the `transition-all` and `duration-500` classes to the span element to make the transition smooth and last for 500ms. The `group-hover:h-full` class makes the span element expand to full height when the link container is hovered over.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
