The error log indicates that node-gyp is unable to find the Python executable on your system. Here are the steps you can follow to fix this issue:

1. Install Python: You need to install Python on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable during the installation process.

2. Set the PYTHON environment variable: If Python is already installed on your system, you need to set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. You can do this by following these steps:

   - Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
   - Click on the Environment Variables button.
   - Under System Variables, click on the New button.
   - Enter PYTHON as the variable name and the path to the Python executable as the variable value (e.g. C:\Python27\python.exe).
   - Click OK to save the changes.

3. Rebuild node-sass: Once you have installed Python and set the PYTHON environment variable, you can try rebuilding node-sass by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   npm rebuild node-sass
   ```

This should rebuild node-sass with the correct dependencies and fix the issue.
