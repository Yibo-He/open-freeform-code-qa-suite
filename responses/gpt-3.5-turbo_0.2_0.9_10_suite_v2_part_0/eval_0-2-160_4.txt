When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your application. 

Source maps are used to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to set breakpoints and step through your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits. It can reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files, as the source map files can be quite large. It can also improve the performance of your application, as the browser does not need to download and parse the source map files.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits, but it also means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.
