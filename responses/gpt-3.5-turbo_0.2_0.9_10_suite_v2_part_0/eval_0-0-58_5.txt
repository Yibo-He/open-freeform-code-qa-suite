The `EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of the downloaded package fails. This error can be caused by various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or even a compromised package.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Upgrade your npm version to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. If you are using a private registry, try to authenticate with the registry by running `npm login` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and then run `npm install` again.

5. If you suspect that the package may be compromised, try installing the package from a different source or using a different version of the package.

6. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, try running `npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/` to switch to the default registry and then try running `npm install` again.

Hopefully, one of these measures will resolve the issue for you.
