The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width or a max-width set. You can add a `max-w-xs` class to limit the width of the element to `20rem` (320px) and make the `truncate` class work as expected. Here's the updated code:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate max-w-xs">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will limit the width of the element to `20rem` and add ellipsis if the text overflows beyond one line. You can adjust the `max-w-xs` class to fit your specific needs.
