Sure! Here's the revised route pattern that should work for your requirements:

```
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?
```

With this pattern, the first parameter `:param1` is required, followed by the static string `/config/`. The second and third parameters `:OptionalParam2` and `:OptionalParam3` are both optional and can be included in any order. 

So, the following URLs will be matched by this pattern:

- `/route/aa/config`
- `/route/aa/config/bb`
- `/route/aa/config/bb/cc`

I hope this helps!
