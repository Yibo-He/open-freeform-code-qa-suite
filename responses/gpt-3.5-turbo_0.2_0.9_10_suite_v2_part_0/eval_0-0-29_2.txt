To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Once it becomes true, you can then run the second query with the `user.id` parameter.

Here's the code for the second query using `useEffect`:

```javascript
const [userBio, setUserBio] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled && user) {
    const { data } = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);
    setUserBio(data);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user]);
```

Note that we're using the `useState` hook to store the result of the second query in the `userBio` variable. We're also watching for changes in both `userFulfilled` and `user` using the `useEffect` hook's dependency array. Once both conditions are met, we run the second query and store the result in `userBio`.
