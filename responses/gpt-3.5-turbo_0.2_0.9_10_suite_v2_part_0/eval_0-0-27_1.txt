It seems like the issue is with the `uri` you are using for the Apollo client. The `uri` you are using (`https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`) is a demo server provided by Apollo Client, and it may not be working properly.

You should replace it with the correct `uri` for your GraphQL server. Make sure that the server is running and accessible from your React Native app.

For example, if you are using a local GraphQL server, you can use `http://localhost:4000/graphql` as the `uri`. If you are using a remote server, you should use the correct URL for that server.

Once you have updated the `uri`, try running the app again and see if it works.
