The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, while the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. You can do this by updating the property to `"../tsconfig.json"`, which will tell ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the parent directory of the `src` directory.

Here's what your updated `.eslintrc.js` file should look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings",
    "plugin:import/typescript",
  ],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json", // Updated path to tsconfig.json
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: [
    "@typescript-eslint",
    "import",
  ],
  rules: {
    // ...
  },
  settings: {
    jsdoc: {
      tagNamePreference: {
        returns: "return",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

After making this change, the error message should disappear and the red lines in your `.ts` files should go away.
