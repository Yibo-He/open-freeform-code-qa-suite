The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not in the PATH environment variable. You need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed and in the PATH.

4. If Python is installed and in the PATH, navigate to your project directory and run `npm install` again.

This should resolve the issue and allow you to build your Node.js project.
