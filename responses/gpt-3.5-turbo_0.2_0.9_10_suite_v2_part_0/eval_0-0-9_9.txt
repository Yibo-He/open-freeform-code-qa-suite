Sure! The error message "Error: req#logout requires a callback function" indicates that the `req.logout()` function requires a callback function as an argument. You can modify your code as follows to resolve the issue:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

Here, we are using the `req.session.destroy()` method to destroy the session and remove the session data. The `req.session.destroy()` method also requires a callback function as an argument. In the callback function, we are checking for any errors and redirecting the user to the home page ("/") after the session is destroyed.
