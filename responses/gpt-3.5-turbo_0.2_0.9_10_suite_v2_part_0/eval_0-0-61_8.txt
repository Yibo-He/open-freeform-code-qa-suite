To change the background color of the root element dynamically with React, you can use the `ThemeProvider` component provided by Material-UI. 

Here's an example of how you can use it to switch between light and dark themes:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import { CssBaseline, Button } from '@material-ui/core';

function App() {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);

  const theme = createMuiTheme({
    palette: {
      type: darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
    },
  });

  const handleThemeChange = () => {
    setDarkMode(!darkMode);
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      <Button onClick={handleThemeChange}>
        {darkMode ? 'Switch to Light Mode' : 'Switch to Dark Mode'}
      </Button>
      {/* Your app content here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we're using the `createMuiTheme` function to create a theme object with a `palette` property that switches between light and dark modes based on the `darkMode` state. We're also using the `CssBaseline` component to apply some basic global styles to the app.

Then, we're wrapping our app content in the `ThemeProvider` component and passing in the `theme` object. Finally, we're using a `Button` component to toggle the `darkMode` state and update the theme dynamically.

With this setup, you should be able to switch between light and dark themes and have the root element background color change dynamically.
