The issue seems to be with the format of the `$theme-colors` variable. In Bootstrap 5, the `$theme-colors` variable should be defined as a map of color names to color values in the format of a string. The error message suggests that the value you provided is not a valid CSS value.

To fix this issue, you can define the `$theme-colors` variable as follows:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace the color values with your desired colors. This should fix the invalid CSS value error and allow you to customize Bootstrap's default theme colors using SASS.
