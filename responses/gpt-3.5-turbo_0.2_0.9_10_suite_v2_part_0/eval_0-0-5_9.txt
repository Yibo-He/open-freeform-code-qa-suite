The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not in your PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to your PATH environment variable. Here are the steps:

1. Download and install Python 2.7.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to your PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and in your PATH:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

4. If you see the version number of Python, then it is installed correctly. If you see an error message, then you need to add Python to your PATH manually.

5. To add Python to your PATH manually, follow these steps:

   - Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
   - Click the Environment Variables button.
   - Under System Variables, scroll down and find the PATH variable. Click Edit.
   - Add the path to the Python installation directory (e.g. C:\Python27) to the end of the PATH variable, separated by a semicolon (;).
   - Click OK to close all windows.

6. Open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is in your PATH:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

7. Now try to rebuild your Node.js project and see if the issue is resolved.
