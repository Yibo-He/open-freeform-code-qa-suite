As of Enzyme version 3.11.0, there is no official adapter for React 17 yet. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues.

Here is the code snippet you can use to configure Enzyme with React 17:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package instead of `enzyme-adapter-react-16`.

With this configuration, you can start writing unit tests with Enzyme in your React 17 app.
