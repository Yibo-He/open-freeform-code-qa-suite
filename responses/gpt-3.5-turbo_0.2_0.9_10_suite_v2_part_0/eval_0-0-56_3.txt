It seems that the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means that it only listens for requests from the same machine. However, when you try to access it from outside the container (e.g. from your host machine), it fails because it can't receive requests from outside the container.

To fix this issue, you need to tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. This will make Vite listen for requests from any IP address, including requests from outside the container.

To do this, you can add the `host` option to your Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This should allow you to access the Vite server from outside the Docker container.

Also, make sure that the Docker container is running and listening on the correct port. You can check this by running the following command inside the container:

```bash
$ netstat -tlnp
```

This should show you a list of all the ports that are currently being listened to by processes inside the container. Make sure that the Vite server is listening on port 8080.
