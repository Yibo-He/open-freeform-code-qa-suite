The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting and analyzing JavaScript code. It seems that ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but is unable to find it.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project. If it is not, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file.

Assuming that your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project, you can update your `.eslintrc.js` file as follows:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings",
    "plugin:import/typescript",
  ],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // update this line
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: [
    "@typescript-eslint",
    "import",
  ],
  // ...
};
```

After making this change, save the file and restart VSCode. The error message should disappear, and you should no longer see red lines in your `.ts` files.
