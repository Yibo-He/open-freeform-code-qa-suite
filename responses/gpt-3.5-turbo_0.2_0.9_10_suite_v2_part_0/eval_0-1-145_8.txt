The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width. You can add the `w-` class to set the width of the element. For example:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate w-40">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, the width of the `span` element is set to `40` using the `w-40` class. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.
