The issue seems to be with the format of the `$theme-colors` variable. In Bootstrap 5, the `$theme-colors` variable should be defined as a map of color names to color values in the format of a string. 

Here's an example of how you can define the `$theme-colors` variable:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to define the color values in the correct format, which is a hexadecimal value without quotes. 

Also, make sure to import the `variables` file before defining the `$theme-colors` variable, as you have done in your example.
