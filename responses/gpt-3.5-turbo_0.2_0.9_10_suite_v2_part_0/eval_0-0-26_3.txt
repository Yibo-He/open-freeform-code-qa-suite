Yes, you can add a displayName to the functional component that is being used as the render function. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the ESLint error:

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: function RenderText(text) {
        return <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;
      },
    }
  ];

RenderText.displayName = 'RenderText';
```

By adding the displayName property to the RenderText function, you are telling ESLint what the name of the component is. This will prevent the ESLint error from being thrown.
