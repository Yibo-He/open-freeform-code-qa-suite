It sounds like you might be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more efficient way by using variables, nesting, and other features. 

In Sass, for example, you can use the `&` symbol to reference the parent selector. So if you have a class called `.button` and you want to add a hover effect to it, you can write:

```
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;

  &:hover {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

This will compile to:

```
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}
```

If you're not using a preprocessor and you're just trying to write regular CSS, you can still use the `.` to target a class. For example:

```
<div class="my-class"></div>

.my-class {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

This will style any element with the class `my-class`. Make sure you're using the correct class name and that your CSS is properly linked to your HTML file.
