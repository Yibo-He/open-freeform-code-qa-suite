To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook and add `user.id` as a dependency. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // user query has been fulfilled, so we can safely run the second query
    userBioFulfilled || refetch(); // refetch only if the second query hasn't been fulfilled yet
  }
}, [user.id, userFulfilled, userBioFulfilled, refetch]);
```

In this code, we're using the `useEffect` hook to run some code after the component has rendered and whenever the `user.id`, `userFulfilled`, `userBioFulfilled`, or `refetch` values change. 

Inside the `useEffect` hook, we're checking if the `user` query has been fulfilled (`userFulfilled` is `true`). If it has, we're checking if the `userBio` query has been fulfilled (`userBioFulfilled` is `true`). If it hasn't, we're calling the `refetch` function to run the query again. 

Note that we're using the `||` operator to only call `refetch` if `userBioFulfilled` is `false`. This is because `refetch` will automatically run the query again if it hasn't been fulfilled yet, so we don't want to call it unnecessarily.
