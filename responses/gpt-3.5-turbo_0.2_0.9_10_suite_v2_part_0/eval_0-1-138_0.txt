Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox by checking the value of the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. 

Here's an example code snippet that you can use to detect if the user is in Dark Mode:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}
```

You can use this media query to apply different styles to your website based on the user's system preference. 

Note that this feature is supported in Safari 12.1+, Chrome 76+, and Firefox 67+.
