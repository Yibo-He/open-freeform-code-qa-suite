It seems like the issue is related to Safari's default behavior of treating flex items as having a minimum height of their content. To fix this, you can add `align-items: flex-start;` to the `.container` class. This will align the flex items to the start of the cross axis, which will allow the `height: auto;` property to work as expected.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

This should fix the issue and allow the images to maintain their aspect ratio while being displayed at the specified width.
