Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode by checking the `prefers-color-scheme` media query in CSS. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}
```

This media query will match if the user's system is in Dark Mode, and you can use it to apply specific styles to your website. 

Note that this feature is supported in Safari 12.1+, Chrome 76+, and Firefox 67+.
