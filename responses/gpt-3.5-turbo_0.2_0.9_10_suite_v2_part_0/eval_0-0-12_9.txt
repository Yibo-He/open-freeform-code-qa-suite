The error message you are receiving indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail are not being accepted. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "Less secure app access". Make sure that this option is turned on.

2. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an "App password" to use instead of your regular Gmail password. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use this instead of your regular Gmail password in your Node.js code.

3. If neither of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "Display Unlock Captcha" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "Display Unlock Captcha". Follow the instructions to enable this feature, and then try running your Node.js code again.

I hope one of these solutions helps you fix the issue and send emails successfully using Node.js.
