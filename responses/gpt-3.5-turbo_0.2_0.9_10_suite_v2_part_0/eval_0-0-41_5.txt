The code you provided looks correct. However, it's possible that the `getCurrentPosition` method is failing silently. To handle errors, you can add a second function as the second argument of `getCurrentPosition` method. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this revised code, if there's an error getting the location, the `error` function will be called and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
