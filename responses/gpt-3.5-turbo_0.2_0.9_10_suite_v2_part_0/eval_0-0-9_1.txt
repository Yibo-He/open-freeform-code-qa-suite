Sure! The error message "Error: req#logout requires a callback function" indicates that the `req.logout()` function requires a callback function as an argument. You can add an empty callback function to the `req.logout()` function to resolve the issue. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
    });
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

By adding an empty callback function, you are satisfying the requirement of the `req.logout()` function. Additionally, you can handle any errors that may occur during the logout process within the callback function.
