It seems like ESLint is not able to find the `tsconfig.json` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is present in the root directory of your project.

2. In your `.eslintrc.js` file, update the `parserOptions` property to include the `tsconfigRootDir` property. This property tells ESLint where to find the `tsconfig.json` file. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   parserOptions: {
     project: "./tsconfig.json",
     tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
     sourceType: "module",
   },
   ```

3. If the above step doesn't work, try specifying the path to the `tsconfig.json` file explicitly in the `parserOptions` property. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   parserOptions: {
     project: "./tsconfig.json",
     tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
     sourceType: "module",
     extraFileExtensions: [".ts"],
     ecmaFeatures: {
       jsx: true,
     },
     createDefaultProgram: true,
     configFile: "./tsconfig.json",
   },
   ```

4. If none of the above steps work, try installing the `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` package and adding it to your `.eslintrc.js` file. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     // ...
     settings: {
       "import/resolver": {
         typescript: {},
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   After installing the package, you may need to restart your editor for the changes to take effect.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
