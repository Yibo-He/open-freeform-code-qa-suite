To connect to Heroku Redis using TLS on Node.js with node_redis v3, you should use the `REDIS_TLS_URL` environment variable instead of `REDIS_URL`. Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const url = require('url');

const redisUrl = url.parse(process.env.REDIS_TLS_URL);
const client = redis.createClient(redisUrl.port, redisUrl.hostname, {
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});

client.auth(redisUrl.auth.split(":")[1]);
```

Note that the `rejectUnauthorized` option is set to `false` in the `tls` object. This is because Heroku Redis uses a self-signed certificate, so the certificate cannot be verified by a trusted certificate authority. Setting `rejectUnauthorized` to `false` disables certificate verification.

Also, make sure that you have the `redis` and `url` modules installed by running `npm install redis url`.
