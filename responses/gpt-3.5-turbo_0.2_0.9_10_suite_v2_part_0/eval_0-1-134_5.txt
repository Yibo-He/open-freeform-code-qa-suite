It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a tool that allows you to write HTML and CSS code faster and more efficiently. Emmet uses abbreviations to generate code snippets. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing the `Tab` key will generate `<div class="classname"></div>`.

To use Emmet, you need to make sure it's enabled in your code editor. Most popular code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom have Emmet built-in or available as an extension.

Once Emmet is enabled, you can start using its abbreviations to generate code snippets. Make sure you're typing the abbreviation in the correct syntax, which is usually a combination of a tag name and a class or ID name. For example, to generate a div with a class of "container", you would type `div.container` and then press the `Tab` key.

If you're still having trouble getting Emmet to work, check the documentation for your code editor or search for tutorials on how to use Emmet with your specific editor.
