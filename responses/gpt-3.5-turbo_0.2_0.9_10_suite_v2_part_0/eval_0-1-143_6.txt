You can modify the `browser.css` file in Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here's how:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for "Profile Folder" under "Application Basics".
4. In the profile folder, create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open `userChrome.css` in a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
menupopup > menuitem {
  padding-top: 4px !important;
  padding-bottom: 4px !important;
}
```

7. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code reduces the padding between menu items to 4 pixels. You can adjust the value to your liking. Keep in mind that modifying Firefox's internal CSS files can cause issues with updates and may need to be updated or removed in the future.
