It sounds like you are trying to use Emmet, a plugin that allows for faster HTML and CSS coding. To use Emmet, you need to make sure it is installed in your code editor. Once it is installed, you can use shorthand syntax to create HTML and CSS code. 

For example, to create a div with a class of "classname", you can type `div.classname` and then press the "Tab" key. This will expand the shorthand into the full HTML code for a div with the class "classname". 

If this is not working for you, make sure that Emmet is installed and enabled in your code editor. You can also check the Emmet documentation for your specific code editor to see if there are any additional steps you need to take to enable Emmet.
