The error message indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection and ensure that you are able to access other websites.
2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.
3. Try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.
4. If none of the above steps work, you can try installing the package directly from GitHub by running `npm install git+https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js.git`.
