It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means it can only be accessed from within the container. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`.

You can do this by modifying the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will bind the Vite server to all available network interfaces, including the one that Docker exposes.

After making this change, rebuild your Docker image and try running the container again:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then try accessing the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`. It should work now.
