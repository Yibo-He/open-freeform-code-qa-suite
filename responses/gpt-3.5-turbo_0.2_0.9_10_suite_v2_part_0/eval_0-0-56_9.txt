It seems that the issue is related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means that it only accepts connections from the same machine. However, when you try to access it from outside the container (e.g. from your host machine), it fails because it cannot accept connections from external sources.

To fix this issue, you need to tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. This will make it accept connections from any source, including your host machine. To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0' // Add this line
    }
})
```

This will make Vite bind to `0.0.0.0` which means that it will accept connections from any source. Once you have made this change, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.

Note that you may need to restart your Docker container after making this change for it to take effect.
