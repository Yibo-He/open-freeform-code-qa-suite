To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the `npm uninstall` command. 

For example, if you installed the `@angular/material` package using `ng add`, you can remove it using the following command:

```
npm uninstall @angular/material
```

This will remove the package from your project and also remove any configuration changes made by the `ng add` command.
