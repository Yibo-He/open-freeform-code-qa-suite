The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   This command should output the version of Python that you installed.

4. Try to rebuild the node-sass module again by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   npm rebuild node-sass
   ```

   This should rebuild the module with the correct dependencies and fix the issue.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to check if there are any other dependencies that need to be installed or updated.
