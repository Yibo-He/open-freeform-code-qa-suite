It sounds like you might be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more efficient way by using variables, nesting, and other features. 

In Sass, for example, you can write:

```
.container {
  width: 100%;
  .box {
    background-color: #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

This will compile to:

```
.container {
  width: 100%;
}
.container .box {
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

If you're using a preprocessor, make sure you have it set up correctly and that you're using the correct syntax. If you're not using a preprocessor, you can still use the `.classname` syntax in your HTML, but you'll need to define the class in your CSS like this:

```
.classname {
  /* styles here */
}
```
