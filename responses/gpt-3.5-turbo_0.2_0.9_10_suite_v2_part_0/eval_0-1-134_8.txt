It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a tool that allows you to write HTML and CSS code faster and more efficiently. Emmet uses abbreviations to generate code snippets, such as `.classname` for a `div` element with a class of `classname`.

To use Emmet, you need to have it installed in your code editor. Most popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom, have Emmet built-in or available as an extension.

Once you have Emmet installed, you can start using its abbreviations to generate code snippets. To generate a `div` element with a class of `classname`, you can type `.classname` and then press the `Tab` key. This should expand the abbreviation into the full HTML code.

If you're still having trouble getting Emmet to work, make sure that it's enabled in your code editor's settings and that you're using the correct syntax for the abbreviation. You can find more information on Emmet's syntax and usage in the documentation for your code editor.
