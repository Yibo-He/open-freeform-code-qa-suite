TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select elements using CSS selectors like `div.section > div`.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in TailwindCSS to define your own custom CSS rules. Here's an example of how you can define a custom rule to select the direct children of `div.section`:

```css
@layer components {
  div.section > div {
    /* Your styles here */
  }
}
```

You can add this code to your `tailwind.config.js` file to define the custom rule. Once you've defined the rule, you can use it in your HTML like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

The custom rule will apply to the direct children of `div.section`.
