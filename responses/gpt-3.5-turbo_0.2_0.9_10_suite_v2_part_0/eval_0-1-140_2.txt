With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for calling an icon has changed. Instead of using the `font-family` property, you can use the `font-weight` and `font-style` properties to call the icon. Here's how you can modify your code to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-weight: 900;
  font-style: normal;
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In this example, we're using the `font-weight` property to call the icon, and setting it to `900` to ensure that the icon is bold. We're also setting the `font-style` property to `normal` to ensure that the icon is not italicized. Finally, we're specifying the font family as "Font Awesome 5 Free" to ensure that the correct font is used.
