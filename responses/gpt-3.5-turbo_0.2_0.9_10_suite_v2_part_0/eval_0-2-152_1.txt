You need to use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here's how you can modify your JS code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default settings. If you want to customize the toast, you can pass an options object to the `.toast()` method. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  delay: 2000 // show the toast for 2 seconds
}).toast('show');
```

This will show the toast for 2 seconds before hiding it. You can customize other options like animation, autohide, etc. by passing them in the options object.
