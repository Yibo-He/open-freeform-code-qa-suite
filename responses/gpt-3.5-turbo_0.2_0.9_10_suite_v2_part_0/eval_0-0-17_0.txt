Sure! You can add an event listener to the editor instance to listen for the "keydown" event, and check if the pressed key is the "Enter" key. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });
  editor.on('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      console.log('good');
      // Add your code to submit the chat and clear the editor here
    }
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

This code adds an event listener to the editor instance that listens for the "keydown" event. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it executes the `console.log("good")` statement. You can add your code to submit the chat and clear the editor inside the if statement.
