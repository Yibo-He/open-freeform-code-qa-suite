The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error message indicates that the integrity check of the downloaded package has failed. This error can occur due to various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or a mismatch between the expected and actual checksum of the package.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and then run `npm install` again.

3. Upgrade your npm version to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. If you are using a proxy server, try disabling it temporarily and then run `npm install` again.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `~/.npm` folder and then run `npm install` again.

6. If you are still facing the issue, try using `yarn` instead of `npm` as it has better error handling and caching mechanisms.

7. If the issue persists, you can try contacting the package maintainer or raising an issue on the package's GitHub repository.
