The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not in the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and in the PATH:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   This should output the version of Python installed on your system.

4. Finally, try to rebuild your Node.js project again and see if the issue is resolved.

If you still encounter the same error, try to restart your computer to ensure that the PATH environment variable is updated.
