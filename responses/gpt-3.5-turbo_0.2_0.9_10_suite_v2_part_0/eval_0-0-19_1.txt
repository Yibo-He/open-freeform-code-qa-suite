The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear your npm cache and then try running `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying a specific version of the package to install by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@2.0.0` (replace `2.0.0` with the version you want to install). If the issue persists, you may want to try again later or contact npm support for further assistance.
