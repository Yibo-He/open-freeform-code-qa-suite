This error occurs because Bootstrap 4 requires Popper.js as a dependency. To fix this error, you need to install Popper.js as a dependency in your project.

You can install Popper.js using npm by running the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install popper.js --save
```

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your JavaScript file before importing Bootstrap. You can do this by adding the following line of code at the beginning of your JavaScript file:

```
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

Make sure to save your changes and try compiling your project again. The error should be resolved now.
