The issue is with the way you are defining your `$theme-colors` map. You need to define the colors as valid CSS values, which means enclosing them in quotes and adding a semicolon at the end of each value. Here's an example:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": "#0d6efd",
  "secondary": "#6c757d",
  "success": "#198754",
  "info": "#0dcaf0",
  "warning": "#ffc107",
  "danger": "#dc3545",
  "light": "#f8f9fa",
  "dark": "#212529"
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Note that each color value is enclosed in quotes and ends with a semicolon. This should fix the invalid CSS value error you were getting.
