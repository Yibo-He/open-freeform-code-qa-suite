When deploying a NextJS app to Vercel, it is important to make sure that your app is configured correctly. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure that you have set up your Vercel account correctly and linked it to your GitHub repository or other source control system.

2. Check your Vercel deployment logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might be causing the issue. You can access the logs by clicking on the "Logs" button in the Vercel dashboard.

3. Make sure that you have included all necessary files in your deployment. This includes any static assets, such as images or CSS files, as well as any server-side code that your app relies on.

4. Check your NextJS configuration to make sure that it is set up correctly. If you don't have a `next.config.js` file, you may need to create one to configure your app for deployment.

5. If you are using dynamic routes in your app, make sure that they are set up correctly. This includes making sure that your API routes are correctly configured and that your app is able to access the necessary data.

6. Finally, make sure that your app is running on the correct port. By default, NextJS apps run on port 3000, but Vercel may use a different port. You can check the port number in your Vercel deployment settings.

If you are still having issues after checking these steps, you may want to reach out to the Vercel support team for further assistance.
