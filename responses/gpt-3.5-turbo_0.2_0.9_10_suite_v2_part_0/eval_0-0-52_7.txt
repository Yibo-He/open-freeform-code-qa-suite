As of now, Angular CLI does not have a built-in command to remove a package installed using `ng add`. However, you can manually remove the package by following these steps:

1. Remove the package from `package.json` file by running `npm uninstall <package-name> --save`.

2. Remove the package from `angular.json` file by opening the file and removing the configuration related to the package. For example, if you installed `@angular/material`, you will find a section in `angular.json` file that looks like this:

```
"styles": [
    "src/styles.css"
],
"scripts": [],
"assets": [],
"projects": {
    "your-project-name": {
        "architect": {
            "build": {
                "options": {
                    "styles": [
                        "node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css",
                        "src/styles.css"
                    ],
                    "scripts": []
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You need to remove the `"node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css"` line from the `"styles"` array.

3. Remove the package from your project by running `rm -rf node_modules/<package-name>`.

After completing these steps, the package should be completely removed from your project.
