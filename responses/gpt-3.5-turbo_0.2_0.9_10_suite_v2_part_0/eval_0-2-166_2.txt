TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework and does not provide a way to select direct children of an element. However, you can use the `@layer` directive to define your own custom CSS rules.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom rule to select direct children of `div` with class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  div.section > div {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

You can add this code to your `tailwind.config.js` file under the `theme` property. This will create a new layer called `components` and allow you to define custom CSS rules.

Once you have defined this rule, you can use it in your HTML like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

The styles you defined for `div.section > div` will be applied to the direct children of `div` with class `section`.
