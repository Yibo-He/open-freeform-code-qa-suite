The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps:

1. Download and install Python 2.7.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option "Add Python to PATH".

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH.

4. If you still get the same error message, try setting the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. For example, if Python is installed in `C:\Python27`, you can set the PYTHON environment variable by running the following command in the command prompt:

   ```
   set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
   ```

5. Try running the build again and see if it succeeds.
