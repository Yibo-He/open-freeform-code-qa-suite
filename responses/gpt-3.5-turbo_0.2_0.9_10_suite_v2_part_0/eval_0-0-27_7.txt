It seems that the issue might be related to the network request. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that your device is connected to the internet and that the API endpoint you are trying to fetch data from is accessible.

2. Try using a different API endpoint or a different query to see if the issue persists.

3. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if the request is being made and if there are any errors or warnings.

4. Try adding a timeout to the ApolloClient configuration to see if the request is taking too long to complete:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    defaultOptions: {
        watchQuery: {
            fetchPolicy: 'no-cache',
            errorPolicy: 'ignore',
            timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds
        },
        query: {
            fetchPolicy: 'no-cache',
            errorPolicy: 'all',
            timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds
        },
    },
});
```

5. If none of the above solutions work, try using a different network library such as Axios or Fetch to make the request and see if the issue persists.
