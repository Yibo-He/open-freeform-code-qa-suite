TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework and does not provide a way to select direct children of an element. However, you can achieve this by using the `@layer` directive and defining your own custom CSS rules.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Define a new layer in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  corePlugins: {
    // ...
    layer: false,
  },
  // Define a new layer
  layers: {
    sectionChildren: {
      // Define your custom CSS rules here
      'div.section > div': ['responsive'],
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

2. Import the new layer in your CSS file:

```
@layer sectionChildren {
  /* Define your custom CSS rules here */
}
```

Now you can use the `div.section > div` selector in your CSS file and it will be applied to the direct children of the `div` element with the `section` class.
