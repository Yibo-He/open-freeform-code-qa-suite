The error message you are getting indicates that there is an issue with the npm executable. It seems like the file has Windows line endings (`^M`) which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Uninstall the existing version of npm using the command `sudo apt-get remove npm`.
2. Install npm again using the command `sudo apt-get install npm`.
3. If the issue persists, try running the following command to convert the line endings of the npm file to Unix format:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install dos2unix
   sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
   ```

   This should remove the Windows line endings from the file and make it executable.

After following these steps, try running the `npm -v` command again to see if the issue has been resolved.
