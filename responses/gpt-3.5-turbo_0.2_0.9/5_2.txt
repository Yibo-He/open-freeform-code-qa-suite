You should modify the `main.ts` file to:

```
import Logo from 'assets/images/logo.png';
```

And modify the `d.ts` file to:

```
declare module "*.png" {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

Then in the `main.html` file, you can use:

```
<img src={Logo.default} alt="" />
``` 

This should resolve the error and allow you to import the image in Typescript.
