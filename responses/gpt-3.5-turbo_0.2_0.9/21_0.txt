Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is not set correctly. Here's the modified code that should work:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y --prefix /usr/local/ ujson aiohttp tqdm
import sys
import os
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages'
import ujson
```

In this modified code, we first import the `os` module. Then we append the path to the `sys.path` list so that Python can find the installed packages. Finally, we set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the correct path where the packages are installed. This should allow you to import the `ujson` module successfully.
