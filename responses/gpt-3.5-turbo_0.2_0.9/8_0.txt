Sure, here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  const utcDate = new Date(date.getTime() + date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
  return utcDate;
}
```

This function takes a `Date` object as input and returns a new `Date` object that represents the same moment in time, but in UTC timezone. 

The function works by first getting the current time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch using the `getTime()` method of the input `Date` object. It then adds the number of minutes in the local timezone offset (which is returned by the `getTimezoneOffset()` method) multiplied by 60 seconds and 1000 milliseconds. This effectively subtracts the local timezone offset from the current time, resulting in the UTC time.

Let me know if you have any questions!
