The issue is with the way you are passing the `booksRefresh` function to the `AddBookForm` component. You need to pass it as a prop, not as a parameter. Here's the fixed definition of `AddBookForm`:

```
import React, {useState} from "react";
import {Redirect} from "react-router";
import {addBook} from "../api/api";
import {Button} from "react-bootstrap";

const AddBookForm = ({booksRefresh}) => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const [description, setDescription] = useState();
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const postRequestHandler = () => {
        addBook(title, description);
        booksRefresh();
    }
...
 return (
        ...
            <Button type="submit" onClick={postRequestHandler} variant="outline-success">Add</Button>
        </div>
    )
```

Note that we are now destructuring the `booksRefresh` function from the props object. This should fix the error you were seeing.
