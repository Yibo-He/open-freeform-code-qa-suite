Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is not set correctly. Here's the modified code that should work:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y --prefix /usr/local/ ujson aiohttp tqdm
import sys
import os
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages'
import ujson
```

I moved the `import os` statement to the top and added the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point to the correct directory. I also moved the `sys.path.append` statement before the `import ujson` statement to ensure that the correct path is added before the module is imported.
