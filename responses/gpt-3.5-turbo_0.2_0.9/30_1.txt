This error message usually occurs when there is a mismatch between the root directory of the project and the root directory of the module. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the root directory of your project and make sure it matches the root directory of your module. You can do this by checking the `settings.gradle` file and the `build.gradle` file of your module.

2. Clean and rebuild your project. Sometimes, this error can occur due to a corrupted build cache. To clean the build cache, go to `Build` > `Clean Project` and then rebuild your project by going to `Build` > `Rebuild Project`.

3. Try disabling Instant Run. Instant Run is a feature in Android Studio that allows you to quickly see changes you make to your code without having to rebuild the entire project. However, it can sometimes cause issues with the build process. To disable Instant Run, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Instant Run` and uncheck the box next to "Enable Instant Run".

4. Check your Gradle version. Make sure you are using a compatible version of Gradle with your version of Android Studio. You can check your Gradle version by going to `File` > `Project Structure` > `Project` and looking at the `Gradle version` field.

5. Try updating your Android Gradle plugin version. You can do this by going to your module's `build.gradle` file and updating the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` version to the latest version.

If none of these steps work, you may
