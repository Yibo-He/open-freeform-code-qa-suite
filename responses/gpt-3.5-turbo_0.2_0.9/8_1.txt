Sure, here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  const utcDate = new Date(date.getTime() + date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
  return utcDate;
}
```

This function takes a `Date` object as an argument and creates a new `Date` object that represents the same moment in time, but in UTC. 

The `getTime()` method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, so we can use it to get the timestamp of the original date. 

The `getTimezoneOffset()` method returns the difference between the local time zone and UTC time zone, in minutes. We multiply this value by 60 (to convert minutes to seconds) and 1000 (to convert seconds to milliseconds) to get the offset in milliseconds. 

Finally, we add the offset to the original timestamp to get the UTC timestamp, and use it to create a new `Date` object. This new object represents the same moment in time, but in UTC.
