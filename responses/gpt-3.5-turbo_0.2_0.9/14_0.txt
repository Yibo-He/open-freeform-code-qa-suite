To deploy your Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages, you can use the following steps:

1. First, you need to generate the static files for your website using the `generate` command. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run generate
```

2. This will create a `dist` folder in your project directory, which contains all the static files for your website.

3. Next, you need to create a new repository on GitHub and push the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. You can do this using the following commands:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin master
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

4. Once the `dist` folder is pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, your website should be live at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.

Note: If your website has dynamic content that depends on user input, you may need to use client-side rendering instead of static rendering. In this case, you can deploy your website as a single-page application (SPA) using a service like Netlify or Heroku. To do this, you would need to build your website using the `build` command instead of the `generate` command, and then deploy the resulting files to your hosting service.
