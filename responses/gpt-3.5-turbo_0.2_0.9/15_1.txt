Certainly! Here's one way to do it using the `io` module to create a buffer for the `FigureCanvas` and then converting that buffer to a `PIL.Image`:

```
import io
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    # Create a canvas for the figure
    canvas = FigureCanvas(input)

    # Create a buffer to hold the canvas data
    buf = io.BytesIO()

    # Save the canvas to the buffer as a PNG
    canvas.print_png(buf)

    # Rewind the buffer to the beginning
    buf.seek(0)

    # Create a PIL Image from the buffer
    img = Image.open(buf)

    return img
```

This function takes a `plt.Figure` as input, creates a `FigureCanvas` for it, and then saves the canvas data to a buffer as a PNG. The buffer is then used to create a `PIL.Image`, which is returned by the function.
