It seems like the issue is with the version-platform combination of MongoDB that you are trying to download. You can try specifying a different version or platform in the options for `MongoMemoryServer`. 

For example, you can try specifying a specific version and platform like this:

```
mongo = new MongoMemoryServer({
  binary: {
    version: '4.2.8',
    platform: 'win32'
  }
});
```

Alternatively, you can try using the `autoStart` option to automatically start the server when it is created:

```
mongo = await MongoMemoryServer.create({
  autoStart: true
});
```

If neither of these options work, you can try manually downloading the MongoDB binary for your platform and specifying the path to it in the `binary` option:

```
mongo = new MongoMemoryServer({
  binary: {
    version: '4.2.8',
    skipMD5: true,
    path: '/path/to/mongodb/bin'
  }
});
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/mongodb/bin` with the actual path to the MongoDB binary on your system.
