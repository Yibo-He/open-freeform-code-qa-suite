It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and check if the library paths are correct. Make sure they match the paths in the error message. If they don't, update them accordingly.

2. Check if the libraries are installed: Make sure the required libraries are installed in your project. You can check this by going to your project's Podfile and checking if the required libraries are listed. If they are not, add them and run `pod install` again.

3. Check if the libraries are linked: Make sure the required libraries are linked to your project. You can check this by going to your project's Build Phases and checking if the required libraries are listed under "Link Binary With Libraries". If they are not, add them by clicking the "+" button and selecting the required libraries.

4. Clean and rebuild: Clean your project by going to Product > Clean and then rebuild it by going to Product > Build.

5. Try removing derived data: Go to Xcode > Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to "Derived Data". Delete the folder for your project and then try rebuilding it.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will work for you.
