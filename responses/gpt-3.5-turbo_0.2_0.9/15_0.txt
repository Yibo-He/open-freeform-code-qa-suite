Sure, here's one way to do it using the `io` module:

```
import io

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    # Create a buffer to hold the image data
    buf = io.BytesIO()

    # Save the figure to the buffer as PNG
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')

    # Move the buffer's position to the beginning
    buf.seek(0)

    # Open the image from the buffer using PIL
    img = Image.open(buf)

    return img
```

This code saves the `Figure` object to a buffer as a PNG image, then opens that image using PIL's `Image.open()` method. The resulting `Image` object can be returned to the caller.
