To deploy your Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages, you can use the following npm command:

```
npm run generate
```

This command generates a static version of your website in the `dist` directory. You can then push the contents of this directory to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub pages for that repository.

To deploy your website as a single page application, you can add the following configuration to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```
export default {
  mode: 'spa'
}
```

This will generate a single page application instead of a server-rendered application. You can then deploy this application to GitHub pages as described above.
