Yes, you can use the Matplotlib inline backend to display the plots directly in the Visual Studio Code editor. To do this, you need to add the following line of code at the beginning of your script:

```
%matplotlib inline
```

Here's the modified code:

```
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Now, when you run the code, the plot will be displayed directly in the editor. If you make any changes to the code, the plot will be updated automatically.
