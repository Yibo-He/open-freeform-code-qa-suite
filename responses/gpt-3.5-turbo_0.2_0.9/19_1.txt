This error occurs when the system limit for the number of files that can be watched is reached. You can try increasing the limit by running the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

If this doesn't work, you can try increasing the limit permanently by adding the following line to your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file:

```
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

After making this change, you will need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
