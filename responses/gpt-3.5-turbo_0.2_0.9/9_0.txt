Yes, you can customize the height of `BottomNavigationBar` in Flutter. You can use the `SizedBox` widget to wrap the `BottomNavigationBar` and set its height as per your requirement. Here's an example:

```dart
Scaffold(
  bottomNavigationBar: SizedBox(
    height: 50, // set the height as per your requirement
    child: BottomNavigationBar(
      // your BottomNavigationBar code here
    ),
  ),
);
```

In the above example, the `SizedBox` widget is used to wrap the `BottomNavigationBar` and its height is set to `50`. You can change the height value as per your requirement.
