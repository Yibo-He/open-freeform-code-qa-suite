This error message indicates that there is a problem with the signing configuration for your app. It seems that the root directory for the signing configuration has changed, causing the build to fail.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check your signing configuration in the build.gradle file and make sure that the root directory is correct.

2. Clean and rebuild your project to ensure that all the files are up-to-date.

3. If the issue persists, try deleting the .gradle and .idea folders in your project directory and then re-importing the project into Android Studio.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try creating a new signing configuration and using that instead.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
