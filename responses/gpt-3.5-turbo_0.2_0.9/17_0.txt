To enable IntelliSense for module paths with aliases in VSCode, you need to configure the `paths` property in your `jsconfig.json` file. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we're telling VSCode that any module path that starts with `@styles/` should be resolved to the corresponding file in the `src/styled/` directory. 

Once you've added this configuration to your `jsconfig.json` file, you should be able to use IntelliSense to access the `@styles` alias by clicking on it.
