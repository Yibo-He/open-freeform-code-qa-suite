It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are some additional steps you can try:

1. Check if the libraries are actually present in the specified directories. If not, try reinstalling them using CocoaPods.

2. Make sure that the library search paths are correctly set in your project's build settings. You can try adding the missing directories manually to the Library Search Paths setting.

3. Check if the library files are included in your project's target. You can do this by going to your project's Build Phases and checking if the libraries are listed under Link Binary With Libraries. If not, add them manually.

4. Try cleaning your project's build folder. You can do this by holding down the Option key while clicking on the Product menu in Xcode and selecting Clean Build Folder.

5. If none of the above steps work, try creating a new Xcode project and adding your source files and libraries to it. This can sometimes fix issues with Xcode's build settings.

I hope one of these steps helps you resolve the issue.
