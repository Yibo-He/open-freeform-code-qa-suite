To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages, you can use the following npm command:

```
npm run generate
```

This command generates a static version of your website in the `dist` directory. You can then push the contents of the `dist` directory to your GitHub repository.

To deploy the website to GitHub pages, you need to enable GitHub pages for your repository. You can do this by going to your repository settings, scrolling down to the GitHub Pages section, and selecting the `master branch /docs folder` option.

Once you have enabled GitHub pages, your website should be accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Note that if your website has content that depends on the user, you will need to use client-side JavaScript to fetch and display that content. This means that you should deploy your website as a single-page application (SPA) rather than a static website. To do this, you can use the following command instead of `npm run generate`:

```
npm run build
```

This command builds a SPA version of your website in the `dist` directory. You can then push the contents of the `dist` directory to your GitHub repository and enable GitHub pages as described above.
