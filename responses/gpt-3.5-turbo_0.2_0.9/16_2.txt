To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen: You can download and install Swagger codegen from the official website or use a package manager like Homebrew.

2. Create a Swagger specification: You need to create a Swagger specification file that describes your REST API. You can use the Swagger Editor or any other editor to create this file.

3. Generate the client: Once you have the Swagger specification file, you can use Swagger codegen to generate the client code. You can use the following command to generate the client:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client in, and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to generate the client code.

For example, to generate a Java client, you can use the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.yaml -l java -o client
```

This will generate a Java client in the `client` directory.

4. Use the client: Once you have generated the client code, you can use it to interact with your REST API. You can import the client code into your project and use it to make API calls.

That's it! You have successfully generated a REST client using Swagger codegen.
