I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always a good practice to save your work frequently, especially when working on a Jupyter Notebook. 

Regarding your issue, it seems like there was an error in the notebook that prevented it from saving properly. Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is blank, it's unlikely that you'll be able to recover your work. 

However, there are a few things you can try:

1. Check if there are any backup files in the same directory as your notebook. Jupyter Notebook creates backup files with the extension `.ipynb~`. If you find any, you can try renaming them to `.ipynb` and opening them in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Check if there are any temporary files in the same directory as your notebook. Jupyter Notebook creates temporary files with the extension `.nbconvert.ipynb`. If you find any, you can try renaming them to `.ipynb` and opening them in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Check if there are any autosave files in the same directory as your notebook. Jupyter Notebook creates autosave files with the extension `.ipynb_autosave`. If you find any, you can try renaming them to `.ipynb` and opening them in Jupyter Notebook.

If none of these options work, unfortunately, it's unlikely that you'll be able to recover your work. In the future, I recommend saving your work frequently and making sure to address any error messages that appear in the notebook.
