Yes, I can help you with that. Here's the completed function:

```
from shutil import copyfile

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        filename = item[0].split("/")[-1] # get the filename from the full path
        destPath = destFolder + "/" + filename # create the destination path
        copyfile(item[0], destPath)
```

This function takes in the `fileList` and `destFolder` as parameters. It then loops through each item in the `fileList`, extracts the filename from the full path using `split("/")[-1]`, creates the destination path by concatenating `destFolder` and the filename, and finally copies the file using `copyfile(item[0], destPath)`.

Note that the error you were getting was because you were trying to copy the files to a folder instead of a file. You need to specify the full path of the destination file, not just the folder.
