This error occurs when the Go language server cannot find the package data for the Redigo package. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the Redigo package is installed correctly. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check that the package is installed in your GoPath. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go list -f '{{.Dir}}' github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   This should return the path to the Redigo package.

3. If the package is installed correctly, try restarting VSCode and see if the error goes away.

4. If the error persists, try adding the following line to your VSCode settings.json file:

   ```
   "gopls": {"experimentalWorkspaceModule": true}
   ```

   This will enable the experimental workspace module for the Go language server, which may help resolve the issue.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue and get intellisense suggestions working in VSCode.
