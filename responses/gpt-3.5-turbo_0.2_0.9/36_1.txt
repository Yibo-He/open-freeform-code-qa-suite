The exception message suggests that you are missing the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency. Even though you have tried adding it to your `pom.xml`, it did not help. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that you have added the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency to the correct `pom.xml` file. If you have a multi-module project, make sure that you have added the dependency to the correct module.

2. Try running a `mvn clean install` command to make sure that all the dependencies are downloaded and installed correctly.

3. Check if there are any conflicting dependencies in your project. You can use the `mvn dependency:tree` command to see the dependency tree of your project and check for any conflicts.

4. Try adding the following configuration to your `application.yml` file:

```
feign:
  client:
    config:
      default:
        ribbon:
          enabled: false
```

This will disable the ribbon load balancer for your feign client.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try upgrading your Spring Boot version to the latest version and see if that resolves the issue.
