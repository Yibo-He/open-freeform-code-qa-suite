To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen: You can install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the Swagger codegen GitHub page.

2. Create a Swagger specification file: You can create a Swagger specification file in YAML or JSON format. This file describes the API endpoints, parameters, and responses.

3. Generate the client code: Once you have the Swagger specification file, you can use Swagger codegen to generate the client code. You can do this by running the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-swagger-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-swagger-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client code in (e.g. Java, Python, Ruby, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to save the generated code.

4. Use the generated client code: Once the client code has been generated, you can use it to make requests to your REST server. The generated code should include classes and methods that correspond to the API endpoints described in your Swagger specification file.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to generate a REST client using Swagger codegen.
