It seems like the issue is related to SSL protocol error. You can try accessing the application using http instead of https. 

If you still want to access the application using https, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the SSL certificate is valid. If it is not valid, you can create a new SSL certificate.

2. Check if the SSL certificate is installed correctly. You can check this by going to the browser settings and looking for the SSL certificate.

3. Check if the SSL port is open. You can check this by running the command `telnet localhost 8080` in the command prompt. If the port is open, you will see a blank screen. If the port is closed, you will see an error message.

4. Check if the firewall is blocking the SSL port. You can check this by disabling the firewall temporarily and trying to access the application.

Regarding the Apache installation, it is not necessary to install Apache to access the application in localhost. The application should be accessible through the localhost URL without any additional software.
