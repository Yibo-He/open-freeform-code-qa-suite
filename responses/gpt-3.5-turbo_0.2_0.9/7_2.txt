Yes, I can help you with that. Here's the completed function:

```
from shutil import copyfile

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        filename = item[0].split("/")[-1]  # get the filename from the full path
        destPath = destFolder + "/" + filename  # create the destination path
        copyfile(item[0], destPath)  # copy the file to the destination folder
```

This function takes in a list of file paths and sizes (`fileList`) and a destination folder (`destFolder`). It loops through each item in `fileList`, extracts the filename from the full path, creates the destination path by concatenating the destination folder and filename, and then copies the file to the destination folder using `copyfile()`. 

You can call this function by passing in your `fileList` and the destination folder path as arguments:

```
copy_from_file_list(fileList, "/Users/username/Desktop/testPhotos")
```

This should copy all the files in `fileList` to the `testPhotos` folder on your desktop.
