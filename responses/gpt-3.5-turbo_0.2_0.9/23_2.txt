The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch a browser process. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed Puppeteer in your project. You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install puppeteer
```

2. Chromium is not installed: Puppeteer requires a version of Chromium to be installed on your system. If you have not installed it, you can do so using the following command:

```
npm install puppeteer-core
```

3. Chromium is not in the PATH: If you have installed Chromium, make sure that it is in the PATH environment variable. You can check this by running the following command:

```
echo $PATH
```

If Chromium is not in the PATH, you can add it by modifying the PATH environment variable.

4. Permissions issue: If you are running the code on a server or in a restricted environment, you may not have the necessary permissions to launch a browser process. In this case, you may need to contact your system administrator or modify the permissions on your system.

Once you have resolved the issue, you should be able to run the code successfully.
