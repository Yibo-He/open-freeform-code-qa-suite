The exception message suggests that you are missing the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency. This is because Feign uses Ribbon for client-side load balancing by default. 

You mentioned that you have already tried adding the dependency but it didn't help. In that case, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have added the dependency in the correct scope. It should be in the `compile` scope, not `test` or `provided`.

2. Try excluding the `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` dependency from the `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign` dependency. This can be done by adding the following to your `pom.xml`:

   ```
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
     <exclusions>
       <exclusion>
         <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
       </exclusion>
     </exclusions>
   </dependency>
   ```

3. If the above steps don't work, you can try explicitly defining a `LoadBalancerFeignClient` bean in your configuration. This can be done by adding the following to your configuration class:

   ```
   @Bean
   @Primary
   public LoadBalancerFeignClient loadBalancerFeignClient(
       final CachingSpringLoadBalancerFactory cachingFactory,
       final SpringClientFactory clientFactory) {
     return new LoadBalancerFeignClient(new DefaultFeignLoadBalancer(cachingFactory, clientFactory));
   }
