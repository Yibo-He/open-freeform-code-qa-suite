It seems like the issue is with the version-platform combination of MongoDB that you are trying to download. You can try specifying a different version or platform in the options of `MongoMemoryServer`. 

For example, you can try specifying a specific version of MongoDB like this:

```
mongo = new MongoMemoryServer({
  instance: {
    version: '4.0.13'
  }
});
```

Or you can try specifying a different platform like this:

```
mongo = new MongoMemoryServer({
  binary: {
    platform: 'osx'
  }
});
```

You can find more information on the available options in the `MongoMemoryServer` documentation.
