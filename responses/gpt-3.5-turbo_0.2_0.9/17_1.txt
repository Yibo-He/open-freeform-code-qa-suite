To enable IntelliSense for module paths with aliases in VSCode, you need to configure the `paths` property in your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example configuration for your case:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

In this configuration, we set the `baseUrl` to the root of our project, and then define a `paths` object with the alias `@styles` and its corresponding path `src/styled/*`. The `include` property specifies the directories to include in the project.

After configuring this, you should be able to use IntelliSense to access the `@styles` alias by clicking on it. For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

Note that you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.
