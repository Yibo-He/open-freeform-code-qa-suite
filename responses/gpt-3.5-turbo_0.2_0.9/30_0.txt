This error message indicates that there is a conflict between the root directories of the files in your project. This can happen when you have moved or renamed files or directories in your project.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Clean and rebuild your project by selecting Build > Clean Project and then Build > Rebuild Project from the Android Studio menu.

2. Check if there are any files or directories in your project that have been moved or renamed. If so, try to revert those changes and see if the error goes away.

3. Check if there are any conflicting dependencies in your project. You can use the Gradle Dependency Analyzer to identify any conflicts and resolve them.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting the .gradle and .idea directories in your project and then re-importing the project into Android Studio.

I hope this helps you to resolve the issue.
