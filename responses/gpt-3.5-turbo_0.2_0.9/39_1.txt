It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are some additional solutions you can try:

1. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and search for "Library Search Paths". Make sure that the paths to the required libraries are correct and that they exist in the specified directories.

2. Check if the libraries are added to your project: Go to your project's Build Phases and search for "Link Binary With Libraries". Make sure that the required libraries are added to your project and that they are not marked as red.

3. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Open your project's Podfile and make sure that the required libraries are added correctly. Then, run "pod install" in your project directory to install the libraries again.

4. Check if the libraries are up-to-date: Open your project's Podfile and run "pod outdated" in your project directory to check if any of the required libraries are outdated. If so, run "pod update" to update the libraries.

5. Check if the libraries are compatible with your Xcode version: Make sure that the required libraries are compatible with your Xcode version. You can check this by going to the library's GitHub page or by checking the library's documentation.

If none of these solutions work, you can try creating a new Xcode project and adding the required libraries again. This should fix any issues related to missing or incorrect library paths.
