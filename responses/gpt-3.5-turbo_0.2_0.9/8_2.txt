Sure! Here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  const utcDate = new Date(date.getTime() + (date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000));
  return utcDate;
}
```

This function takes in a `Date` object and creates a new `Date` object with the UTC time equivalent to the input date. The `getTime()` method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, so we add the time zone offset (in minutes) to get the UTC time. We then create a new `Date` object with this UTC time and return it.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:

```javascript
const localDate = new Date();
console.log(localDate); // outputs the local date and time
const utcDate = convertToUTC(localDate);
console.log(utcDate); // outputs the UTC date and time
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
