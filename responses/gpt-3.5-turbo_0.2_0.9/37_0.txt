To obtain the screen height, you can use the following code:

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val insets = windowMetrics.windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.systemBars())

    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom
    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val height = b.height() - insetsHeight

    return height
}
```

This code uses the `WindowMetrics` class to obtain the screen height. The `WindowMetrics` class provides information about the size and position of the window, including any system decorations such as the status bar and navigation bar. 

The `insets` variable is used to obtain the height of any system decorations that are currently visible. This includes the status bar and navigation bar. 

The `height` variable is then calculated by subtracting the height of the system decorations from the total height of the window. This gives you the actual height of the usable screen area.

You can call this function by passing the `WindowManager` object as a parameter:

```
val height = getWidthHeight(wm)
``` 

This will return the height of the usable screen area in pixels.
