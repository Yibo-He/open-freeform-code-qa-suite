This error occurs when the Go extension in VSCode is unable to find the package data for the Redigo package. To solve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that Redigo is installed properly by running `go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` in your terminal.

2. Check if the package is present in your GoPath by running `ls $GOPATH/src/github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` in your terminal. If the package is not present, then it means that the installation was not successful.

3. If the package is present, then try restarting VSCode and see if the error goes away.

4. If the error still persists, then try adding the following line at the top of your Go file:

   ```go
   //go:generate go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   This line will ensure that the Redigo package is installed before the code is compiled.

5. If none of the above steps work, then try updating the Go extension in VSCode to the latest version.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
