Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter using the `SharedPreferences` class. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the `shared_preferences` package:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
```

2. Get an instance of the `SharedPreferences` class:

```dart
SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
```

3. Call the `clear()` method to delete all saved preferences:

```dart
await prefs.clear();
```

This will delete all saved preferences in a single shot. You can call this method when the user taps on logout.
