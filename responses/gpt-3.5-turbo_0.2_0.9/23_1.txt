The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed the Puppeteer library by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chrome is not installed: Puppeteer relies on a version of the Chrome browser to run. Make sure that you have installed Chrome on your system.

3. Chrome is not in the default location: If Chrome is installed in a non-default location, you will need to specify the path to the executable when launching Puppeteer. You can do this by passing an object with the `executablePath` property to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

4. Permissions issue: If you are running the code on a server or in a restricted environment, you may not have the necessary permissions to launch a browser process. In this case, you may need to contact your system administrator or hosting provider.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try running the code with the `headless` option set to `false` to see if the browser launches correctly:

```
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
```

If the browser launches correctly, then the issue is likely related to one of the above reasons. If the browser still fails to launch, you may need to provide more information about your system and environment to diagnose the issue.
