This error occurs when the Go language server is unable to find the package data for the Redigo package. To solve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the Redigo package is installed correctly. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if the package is installed in the correct directory. The package should be installed in the `src` directory of your GoPath.

3. If the package is installed correctly, try restarting VSCode and see if the error persists.

4. If the error still persists, try adding the following line to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

   ```
   "go.useLanguageServer": false
   ```

   This will disable the Go language server and use the traditional Gocode instead.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and you will be able to use intellisense suggestions for the Redigo package.
