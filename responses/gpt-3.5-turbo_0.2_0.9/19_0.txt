This error occurs when the operating system's limit on the number of open files is reached. The watch process that is used by the Metro bundler to monitor file changes is hitting this limit.

To fix this issue, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the limit of the number of open files on your operating system. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   ulimit -n 10000
   ```

   This will increase the limit to 10000 files. You can adjust the number as per your requirement.

2. Close any unnecessary applications or processes that are running on your system to free up resources.

3. If you are using a Windows operating system, you can try running the command prompt as an administrator.

4. You can also try upgrading your Node.js version to the latest stable release.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try deleting the node_modules folder and reinstalling the dependencies using the following commands:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

   This will remove the existing dependencies and install them again.

I hope this helps!
