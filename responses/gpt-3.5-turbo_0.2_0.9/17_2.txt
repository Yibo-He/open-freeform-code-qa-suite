To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to configure the `paths` property in your `jsconfig.json` file. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/node_modules/*"]
}
```

In this example, we're setting the `baseUrl` to the current directory and defining a path alias `@styles` that maps to the `src/styled` directory. The `*` at the end of the alias tells VSCode to match any file or directory within the `src/styled` directory.

Once you've configured your `jsconfig.json` file, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and have IntelliSense work as expected. For example:

```javascript
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

When you hover over `@styles/Button` in VSCode, it should show you the path to the `Button` module and allow you to click on it to open the file.
