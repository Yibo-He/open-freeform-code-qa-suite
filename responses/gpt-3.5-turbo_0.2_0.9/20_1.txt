I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. Unfortunately, it sounds like the autosave feature in Jupyter Notebook did not work properly, and the checkpoint file is also empty. 

One thing you can try is to look for any temporary files that Jupyter Notebook may have created. On a Mac, you can do this by opening the Terminal and navigating to the directory where your notebook file is saved. Then, type `ls -a` to show all files, including hidden ones. Look for any files that start with `.~` or end with `.swp`. These are temporary files that Jupyter Notebook may have created while you were working on the notebook. If you find any, try opening them in a text editor to see if they contain any of your lost work.

Another option is to check if your text editor or IDE has a backup or recovery feature. Some editors automatically save backup copies of your files, which you may be able to recover.

If neither of these options work, unfortunately, it may not be possible to recover your lost work. In the future, I recommend saving your work frequently and making backups to avoid losing important data.
