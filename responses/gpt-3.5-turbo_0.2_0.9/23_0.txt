The error message suggests that Puppeteer is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed Puppeteer by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chrome is not installed: Puppeteer relies on a version of Chrome to run. Make sure that you have Chrome installed on your system.

3. Chrome is not in the expected location: Puppeteer expects to find Chrome in a specific location. If Chrome is installed in a non-standard location, you may need to specify the path to Chrome when launching Puppeteer.

4. Permissions issue: Make sure that the user running the code has permission to launch Chrome.

To fix the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that Puppeteer is installed by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Check that Chrome is installed on your system. If it is not installed, you can download it from the official website.

3. If Chrome is installed in a non-standard location, you can specify the path to Chrome when launching Puppeteer. For example:

```
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  executablePath: '/path/to/chrome'
});
```

4. Make sure that the user running the code has permission to launch Chrome. You may need to run the code as an administrator or grant the necessary permissions to the user.
