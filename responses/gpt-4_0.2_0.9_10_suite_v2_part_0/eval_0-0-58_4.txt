The `EINTEGRITY` error is a checksum error that occurs when the package's checksum in the `npm` registry doesn't match the calculated checksum on your machine. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as network issues, npm cache corruption, or even issues with the package itself.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Clear npm cache**: The npm cache might be corrupt. Clear it by running `npm cache clean --force`. Then try installing the package again.

2. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json**: Sometimes, the `node_modules` folder or `package-lock.json` file might be causing the issue. Delete both and then run `npm install` again.

    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

3. **Update npm**: The issue might be with npm itself. Try updating npm to the latest version using `npm install -g npm@latest`.

4. **Check your network**: If you're behind a proxy or your network is unstable, it might cause this error. Try switching to a different network or disabling the proxy and then run `npm install` again.

5. **Use a different package version**: If the issue is with the package itself, try installing a different version of the package.

6. **Use Yarn**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try using Yarn as an alternative to npm. Install Yarn using `npm install -g yarn`, then run `yarn` to install the packages.

Remember to replace `npm install` with the actual command you're running if it's different.
