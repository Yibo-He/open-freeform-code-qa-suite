The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single-line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` on an element. So, if you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach.

Unfortunately, Tailwind CSS does not provide a utility for multi-line text truncation out of the box. However, you can achieve this by adding some custom CSS to your project.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```css
.line-clamp {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2; /* Number of lines to display before truncating */
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after 2 lines. You can adjust the `-webkit-line-clamp` value to change the number of lines before truncation.

Please note that this method uses the `-webkit-` prefix, which means it may not work in all browsers. It is well-supported in most modern browsers, but it's always a good idea to check the compatibility if you're targeting a wide range of browsers.
