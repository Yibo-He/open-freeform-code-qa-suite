The error log indicates that Python is not found in your system. Node-gyp, which is a dependency of node-sass, requires Python to be installed in your system. 

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7.x. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Node-gyp does not support Python 3.x, so make sure to install a 2.7.x version.

2. After installing Python, you need to add it to your system's PATH. Here's how to do it:

    - Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
    - Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
    - Click Environment Variables...
    - Select PATH in the System variables section
    - Click Edit
    - Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example, if you installed Python to 'C:\Python27', then you would add ';C:\Python27' to the end of the text in the Variable value field.

3. After adding Python to the PATH, you should be able to run Python from the command line. You can test this by opening a command prompt (Win+R, cmd, Enter) and typing 'python'. If you see the Python interpreter prompt (>>>), then Python is installed and working correctly.

4. Now, you should be able to build your Node.js project without any issues.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to configure npm to know the path of Python by running the following command:

```bash
npm config set python /path/to/executable/python
```

Replace `/path/to/executable/python` with the actual path to your Python executable.

If you're using a version of node-gyp that does not support the version of Node.js you're using, you might need to update node-gyp or downgrade Node.js.
