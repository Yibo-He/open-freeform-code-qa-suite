It seems like you want to move the "Stop Game" button to the top of the game frame, similar to the "Begin Game" button. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **HTML Layout**: You could rearrange your HTML elements so that the "Stop Game" button is in the same container as the "Begin Game" button. This way, they will be in the same context and you can control their position more easily. 

2. **CSS Flexbox**: You can use CSS Flexbox to align your buttons. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to allow extra items to fit.

Here's an example of how you could modify your HTML and CSS:

HTML:
```html
<div id="GameControls">
  <button id="StartBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="gameStarted=true;">Begin Game</button>
  <button id="StopBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="self.close()">Stop Game</button>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
#GameControls {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

In this example, the `display: flex;` property makes the `GameControls` div a flex container, and the `justify-content: space-between;` property places the buttons at the far ends of the container.

3. **CSS Grid**: Alternatively, you can use CSS Grid, which is a two-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows and columns. It's more flexible than Flexbox when it comes to 2D layouts.

Here's an example of how you could use CSS Grid:

CSS:
```css
#GameControls {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

In this example, the `display: grid;` property makes the `GameControls` div a grid container, and the `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;` property creates two equally-sized columns for the buttons.

Remember to remove the `<br>` tags and any other elements that might be causing unnecessary space between your buttons.
