You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. However, please note that this will only work if the arrow is being generated using CSS (which is the case in Bootstrap 5). If the arrow is an image or an icon, you will need to replace it with a green version.

Also, please note that the accordion arrow in Bootstrap 5 is a background image. So, you may need to override it with your own image or use a Unicode character as an arrow. Here is an example:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    content: "\25B2"; /* Unicode character for arrow */
    color: green;
}
.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    content: "\25BC"; /* Unicode character for arrow */
    color: green;
}
```

In this example, `\25B2` is the Unicode character for an up arrow and `\25BC` is for a down arrow. The `:not(.collapsed)::after` targets the arrow when the accordion is open, and `.collapsed::after` targets it when the accordion is closed.
