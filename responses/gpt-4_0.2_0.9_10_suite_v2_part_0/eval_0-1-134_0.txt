It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

For example, in HTML, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If it's not working for you, it might be because:

1. You're not using a text editor that supports Emmet. Emmet is built in to many text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc. If you're using a text editor that doesn't support Emmet, you might need to install it manually.

2. Emmet is not enabled. If your text editor supports Emmet but it's not working, make sure it's enabled in your editor's settings.

3. You're not pressing the right key to expand the abbreviation. In most editors, you need to press `Tab` to expand an Emmet abbreviation, but this might vary depending on your editor's settings.

4. You're not using the correct syntax. Emmet uses a specific syntax to create HTML and CSS. Make sure you're following this syntax correctly.

If you're still having trouble, let me know what text editor you're using and I can provide more specific help.
