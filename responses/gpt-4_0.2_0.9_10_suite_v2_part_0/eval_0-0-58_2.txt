The `EINTEGRITY` error is a common issue that happens when the `npm` client fails to verify the integrity of your package. This error is often caused by a corrupt local cache.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache**: Run the command `npm cache clean --force`. This will forcefully clear the npm cache.

2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory**: If you have a `node_modules` directory in your project, delete it. This directory contains the installed packages for your project. Deleting it will allow npm to reinstall your packages from scratch.

3. **Delete the `package-lock.json` file**: If you have a `package-lock.json` file in your project, delete it. This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` directory or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

4. **Reinstall your packages**: Run the command `npm install`. This will reinstall your packages.

5. **Update npm**: If the problem persists, try updating npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest`.

6. **Check your network connection**: If you're still having issues, it might be a network problem. Check your network connection and try again.

Remember to always back up your project before making any major changes like these.
