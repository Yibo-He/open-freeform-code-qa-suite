You can try wrapping the `Switch` component and the `span` inside a `div` or any other container. This is because the `Form.Item` component expects a single child component. Here is the revised version of your code:

```html
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <div>
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
    <span>Chargable</span>
  </div>
</Form.Item>
```

This should work as expected and the `onCreate` function should now be able to access the value from the switch.
