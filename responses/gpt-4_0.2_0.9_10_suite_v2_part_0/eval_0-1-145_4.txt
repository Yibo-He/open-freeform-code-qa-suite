The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works for a single line of text. If the text overflows more than one line, the `truncate` class won't work as expected.

If you want to truncate the text to a specific number of lines, you can use the `line-clamp-{n}` utility provided by TailwindCSS. However, this utility is not included by default in TailwindCSS, you need to enable it in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Enable the `lineClamp` plugin in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  variants: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
  ],
}
```

2. Then you can use the `line-clamp-{n}` utility in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, the `line-clamp-1` utility will truncate the text to 1 line.

Please note that the `line-clamp-{n}` utility is not fully supported in all browsers. It is not supported in IE and has partial support in Edge. For full browser support, you can check [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/?search=line-clamp).
