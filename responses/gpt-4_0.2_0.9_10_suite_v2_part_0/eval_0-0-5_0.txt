The error log indicates that Python is not found in your system. Node-gyp, which is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, requires Python to work.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7.x. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Node-gyp does not work with Python 3.x, so make sure to install a 2.7.x version.

2. After installing Python, you need to set the environment variable `PYTHON` to point to Python executable. You can do this by following these steps:

   - Open the System Properties (Press Windows Key + Pause)
   - Click on the "Advanced" tab
   - Click on "Environment Variables"
   - Click "New" under "System variables"
   - Enter `PYTHON` in the "Variable name" field
   - Enter the path to your Python executable in the "Variable value" field. It should look something like `C:\Python27\python.exe`

3. After setting the environment variable, restart your system to make sure the changes take effect.

4. Now, try to build your Node.js application again. The build should now pass as Python is installed and the environment variable is set.

If you're still having issues, you might need to update your version of node-gyp or node-sass to a more recent version, as older versions might have compatibility issues with newer versions of Node.js.
