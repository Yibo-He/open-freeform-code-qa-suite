It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

For example, if you type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, it should automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If it's not working for you, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check if your text editor supports Emmet**: Emmet is built-in in many text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. If you're using a text editor that doesn't support Emmet, you may need to install it manually.

2. **Check if Emmet is enabled**: If your text editor supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled. For example, in VS Code, you can check this by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for `Emmet`.

3. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct Emmet syntax. For a class, it should be `.classname`, and for an id, it should be `#idname`.

4. **Check your file type**: Emmet usually works automatically in HTML and CSS files. If you're working in a different type of file, you may need to manually trigger Emmet.

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, you may want to look for specific instructions for your text editor.
