Your code seems fine at first glance. However, there are a few things you could check to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper network connection. Sometimes, the issue might be as simple as a network problem.

2. **Server Availability**: Check if the GraphQL server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by pasting the URL into a web browser and seeing if it loads.

3. **Query Syntax**: Make sure the query you're making is correct and the server supports it. You can test your query using a GraphQL playground or a tool like GraphiQL.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to an earlier version to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **Error Handling**: The `error` object from `useQuery` should provide more information about what's going wrong. If `error` is `undefined`, it means that the query is still loading or there was no error. If the query is hanging, it might be that an error occurred but wasn't thrown. Try logging `error.message` to get more details.

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, make sure to enable network inspect. This will allow you to see the network requests made by Apollo Client and check if the request is sent and what the response is.

7. **Apollo Client Setup**: Ensure that the Apollo Client is set up correctly. The `uri` should point to your GraphQL endpoint and the `cache` should be an instance of `InMemoryCache`.

If none of the above solutions work, it would be helpful to see any error messages or logs you're getting. This would provide more context and make it easier to identify the issue.
