The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap`. 

If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you will need to use a different approach because CSS doesn't natively support multiline text truncation.

Here's a workaround using line-clamp in Tailwind CSS:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold overflow-hidden overflow-ellipsis">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In your Tailwind CSS configuration file, you need to enable the `lineClamp` plugin:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: (theme) => ({
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            // ...
          },
        },
      }),
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

Then, you can use the `line-clamp-{n}` utility to limit the text to a specific number of lines:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will limit the text to 1 line and add an ellipsis if it overflows. You can replace `1` with any number to specify the maximum number of lines.
