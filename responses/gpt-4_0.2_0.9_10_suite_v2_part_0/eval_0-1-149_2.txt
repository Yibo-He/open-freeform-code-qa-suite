Sure, you can achieve this by using the `group-hover` class in Tailwind CSS. This class applies styles to an element when its parent is being hovered over. 

Here is an example of how you can modify your code to create an animation when hovering over the link:

```html
<a href="#" class="group">
    <span class="text-sky-600 transition-all duration-300">Link</span>
    <span class="block w-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this example, the width of the span is initially set to 0 (`w-0`) and then changes to full width (`w-full`) when the link is hovered over. The `transition-all` and `duration-500` classes are used to animate this change in width.

Please note that the `group-hover` variant is not enabled for all utilities by default in Tailwind CSS. If it's not working, you may need to enable it in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`). Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration will enable the `group-hover` variant for the `width` utility.
