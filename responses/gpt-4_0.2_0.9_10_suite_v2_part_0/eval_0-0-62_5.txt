The error message is indicating that Vue.js is expecting a primitive value (string or number) as a key for the `v-for` directive, but it's getting a non-primitive value (in this case, an object) instead.

In your case, you're using `comment` as a key, which is an object. Vue uses the `key` attribute to track each node's identity, so it can reuse and reorder existing elements. You should use a unique primitive value, like an id.

If each comment has a unique id, you can use it as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember that it's important to have unique keys for all v-for iterations, it helps Vue to correctly maintain the state during updates.
