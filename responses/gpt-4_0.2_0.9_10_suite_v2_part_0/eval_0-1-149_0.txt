Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a simple example of how you can create a hover animation using Tailwind CSS. 

In this example, we will create an underline animation for a link. When you hover over the link, the underline will animate from left to right.

```html
<a href="#" class="group inline-block relative overflow-hidden text-sky-600">
    Link
    <span class="absolute h-0.5 bg-sky-600 bottom-0 left-0 transform translate-x-full group-hover:translate-x-0 transition-transform duration-300"></span>
</a>
```

Here is the explanation of the code:

- `group`: This class is used to apply styles to nested elements on hover.
- `inline-block relative overflow-hidden`: These classes are used to set the link's position and hide the underline that is initially positioned off the screen.
- `absolute h-0.5 bg-sky-600 bottom-0 left-0`: These classes are used to position the underline at the bottom of the link and set its height and color.
- `transform translate-x-full group-hover:translate-x-0`: These classes are used to animate the underline. Initially, the underline is positioned off the screen (`translate-x-full`). When you hover over the link, the underline moves to its original position (`translate-x-0`).
- `transition-transform duration-300`: These classes are used to set the type of transition and its duration.

Please note that you need to enable the `group-hover` variant for the `transform` utility in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) if it's not enabled by default:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {},
  variants: {
    extend: {
      transform: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Also, make sure to rebuild your CSS after making changes to your Tailwind CSS configuration file.
