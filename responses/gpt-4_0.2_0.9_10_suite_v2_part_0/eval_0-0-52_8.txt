Angular CLI does not provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open the `package.json` file in your project directory.

2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.

3. Remove the line that includes the package name.

4. Save the `package.json` file.

5. Run the following command in your terminal to update the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove a package:

- If you are using npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

- If you are using yarn, run the following command:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

These commands will remove the package from the `node_modules` directory and `package.json` file.
