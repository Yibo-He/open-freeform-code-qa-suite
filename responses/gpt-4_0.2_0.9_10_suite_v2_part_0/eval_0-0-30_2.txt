Enzyme currently does not officially support React 17. However, there is an unofficial adapter available that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`.

First, you need to install it:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that since this is an unofficial adapter, it might not work perfectly with React 17. If you encounter any issues, you might want to consider using the official React testing library instead.
