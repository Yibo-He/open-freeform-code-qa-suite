Yes, you can modify the user interface of Firefox by adding custom CSS rules. To reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton, you need to modify the `userChrome.css` file. Here are the steps:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.

2. Click on "Accept the Risk and Continue".

3. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

4. Now, navigate to your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then under the "Application Basics" section, click on "Open Directory" next to "Profile Directory".

5. In the profile directory, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

6. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css` if it doesn't exist.

7. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and paste the following code:

```css
/* Reduce Menu Spacing in Firefox Proton */
menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

8. Save the file and close it.

9. Restart Firefox to apply the changes.

This CSS rule reduces the padding of the menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the `4px` value to your liking. If you want even less space, reduce the number. If you want more space, increase the number.
