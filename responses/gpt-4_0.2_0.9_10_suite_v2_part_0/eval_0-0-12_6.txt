The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` is indicating that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not correct. 

Here are a few things you can do to fix this:

1. **Check your username and password**: Make sure that the username (email) and password you are using are correct. Try logging into Gmail with these credentials to verify them.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You can change your settings to allow less secure apps into your account. However, this is not recommended as it may leave your account vulnerable. Here is the link to enable it: [Less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

3. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you might need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. An App Password is a 16-digit passcode that gives less secure apps or devices permission to access your Google Account. Here is the link to generate app password: [App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

4. **Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may require you to confirm it's you with Captcha. You can unlock it by visiting this link: [Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha)

Remember to replace the password in your code with the new generated App Password if you choose to use an App Password.
