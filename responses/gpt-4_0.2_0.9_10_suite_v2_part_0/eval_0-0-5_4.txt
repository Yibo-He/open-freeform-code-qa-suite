The error log shows that the Python executable cannot be found in your PATH. Node-gyp, which is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, requires Python to work.

Here's how you can fix this:

1. Install Python 2.7.x (node-gyp does not work with Python 3.x). You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. After installing Python, add it to your system PATH. Here's how you can do it:

   - Open the System Properties (Press Windows Key + Pause).
   - Click on the "Advanced" tab.
   - Click on "Environment Variables".
   - Under "System Variables", find the PATH variable, select it, and click on "Edit".
   - In the Edit window, append the path of your Python installation directory to the PATH variable. Make sure to separate it from the existing paths by a semicolon (`;`). For example, if you installed Python in `C:\Python27\`, add `;C:\Python27\` at the end of the PATH variable.
   - Click OK in all windows to apply the changes.

3. Restart your system or open a new command prompt for the changes to take effect.

4. Try building your Node.js project again.

If you still encounter issues, you can set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of your Python executable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the System Properties (Press Windows Key + Pause).
2. Click on the "Advanced" tab.
3. Click on "Environment Variables".
4. Under "User variables", click on "New".
5. Set "Variable name" to `PYTHON` and "Variable value" to the path of your Python executable (e.g., `C:\Python27\python.exe`).
6. Click OK in all windows to apply the changes.
7. Restart your system or open a new command prompt for the changes to take effect.
8. Try building your Node.js project again.
