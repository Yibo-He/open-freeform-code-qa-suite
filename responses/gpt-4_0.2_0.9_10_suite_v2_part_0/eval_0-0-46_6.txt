The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` suggests that ESLint is having trouble finding your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you will need to provide the correct relative path to it.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a subdirectory of the directory containing your `.eslintrc.js` file, you would need to include the name of the subdirectory in the path, like so: `"./subdirectory/tsconfig.json"`.

Here is how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./path/to/your/tsconfig.json", // update this line with the correct path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Replace `"./path/to/your/tsconfig.json"` with the correct relative path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

After making this change, save the `.eslintrc.js` file and restart your editor. If the path is correct, ESLint should now be able to find and read your `tsconfig.json` file, and the error should be resolved.
