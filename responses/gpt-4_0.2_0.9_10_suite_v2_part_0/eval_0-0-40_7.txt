The problem you're experiencing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu and the ones installed in your Windows system. The `whereis` command shows that there are two versions of Node.js and npm installed: one in `/usr/bin/` (WSL2 Ubuntu) and another in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` (Windows).

When you run `node -v`, it's using the Node.js installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu, but when you run `npm -v`, it's trying to use the npm installed in your Windows system, which doesn't work because of the different file system and environment.

To solve this issue, you can remove the Windows path from the WSL2 Ubuntu `$PATH` variable. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file with a text editor. You can use `nano`:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g') # strip out problematic Windows %PATH% imported var
```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Reload your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should use the npm installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu. If you still encounter the problem, you might need to reinstall npm in your WSL2 Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```
