The `EINTEGRITY` error is a checksum error that occurs when the package's checksum in the npm registry doesn't match the calculated checksum on your machine. This could be due to a number of reasons such as network issues, npm cache corruption, or even issues with the package itself.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache**: The npm cache could be corrupt. You can clear it using the command `npm cache clean --force`. 

2. **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`**: Sometimes, the issue could be with the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file. Delete both and then try running `npm install` again. 

    ```
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

3. **Update npm**: The issue could be with the version of npm you're using. Try updating npm using the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.

4. **Check your network connection**: If you're on a spotty network connection, it could cause issues with the integrity check. Try switching to a more stable network connection and then run `npm install` again.

5. **Use `--no-shrinkwrap` option**: This option will ignore the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file if it exists in the package. Run `npm install --no-shrinkwrap`.

6. **Use a different package version**: If none of the above solutions work, the issue could be with the package itself. Try using a different version of the package.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
