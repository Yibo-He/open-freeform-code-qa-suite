You can modify the userChrome.css file to reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar, then clicking on "Open Folder" next to "Profile Folder".

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css` if it doesn't already exist.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor.

5. Paste the following CSS code into the file:

```css
/* Reduce padding on menu items */
menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

6. Save and close the file.

7. Now, you need to tell Firefox to use your custom CSS. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue".

8. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the arrow icon.

9. Restart Firefox to see the changes.

This CSS reduces the padding on menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the `4px` value to your liking. Note that this might not work on future versions of Firefox if they decide to change how the UI is built.
