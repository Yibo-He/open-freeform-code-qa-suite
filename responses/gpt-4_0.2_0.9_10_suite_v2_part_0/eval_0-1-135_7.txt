The issue you're experiencing is a known bug in Safari's implementation of Flexbox. When an image is a flex child, Safari does not correctly maintain the aspect ratio of the image when `height: auto` is used.

To work around this issue, you can wrap the image in a `div` and apply the width to the `div` instead of the image. The image can then be set to `width: 100%` and `height: auto` to maintain its aspect ratio.

Here's how you can modify your CSS and HTML:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container .img-container {
  width: 125px;
}

.container img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
```

This should solve the issue in Safari while still working correctly in other browsers.
