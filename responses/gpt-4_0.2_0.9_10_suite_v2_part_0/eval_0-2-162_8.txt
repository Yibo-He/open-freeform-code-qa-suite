Sure, you can achieve this by using the 'scroll' event and changing the 'style.backgroundColor' property. Here is the completed code:

```javascript
const [red, green, blue] = [69, 111, 225]
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1')

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  let y = 1 + (window.scrollY || window.pageYOffset) / 150
  y = y < 1 ? 1 : y // ensure y is always >= 1 (due to Safari's elastic scroll)
  const [r, g, b] = [red/y, green/y, blue/y].map(Math.round)
  section1.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`
})
```
In this code, the 'scroll' event is used to trigger the function whenever the user scrolls. The 'style.backgroundColor' property is used to change the background color of the 'section1' element. The color is calculated based on the scroll position, resulting in a dynamic color change as the user scrolls.
