Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is now separated into different styles: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. The `content` values have also been changed for some icons.

The `f107` unicode corresponds to the `angle-down` icon. In Font Awesome 5, this icon is available in the `solid` style.

Here is how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900; /* Use 900 for Solid, 400 for Regular, and 300 for Light */
}
```

Remember to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```

Also, make sure that the icon you are trying to use is available in the style you are using (Solid, Regular, or Light). Not all icons are available in all styles. You can check this on the Font Awesome website.
