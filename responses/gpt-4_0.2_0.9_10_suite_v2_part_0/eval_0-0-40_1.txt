The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and WSL versions of Node.js and npm. The Windows version of npm is being called instead of the WSL version, and because Windows uses a different line ending format than Unix/Linux, you're seeing the `bad interpreter: No such file or directory` error.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the WSL version of npm is being used instead of the Windows version. You can do this by adjusting your PATH environment variable.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use nano, vim, or any other text editor you prefer. For example:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ```

    This line ensures that the `/usr/bin` directory, which contains the WSL version of npm, is searched before any other directories when looking for executables.

3. Save and close the file. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Source your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

5. Now, if you run `npm -v`, you should see the version of npm installed on WSL, and you should no longer see the `bad interpreter: No such file or directory` error.

Remember, this solution assumes that you have installed Node.js and npm in WSL using a package manager like apt. If you installed them using a different method, the executables might be located in a different directory. In that case, you'll need to adjust the `export PATH` line accordingly.
