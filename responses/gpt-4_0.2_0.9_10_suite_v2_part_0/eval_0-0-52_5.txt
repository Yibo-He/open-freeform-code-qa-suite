Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can manually remove a package from your Angular project by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.

3. Delete the line that contains the package.

4. Save the `package.json` file.

5. Run the following command in your terminal to update your `node_modules` folder:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will reinstall all packages listed in your `package.json` file, excluding the one you just removed.

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove a package:

- With npm:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

- With yarn:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

These commands will remove the package from your `node_modules` folder and also update your `package.json` file.
