You can use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This line of code selects the element with the class `toast` and calls the `toast` method with the argument `'show'`, which will display the toast.

Please ensure that you have included the necessary Bootstrap JavaScript file in your HTML file. If you haven't, you can include it with the following line of code:

```html
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Also, make sure that you have jQuery included before the Bootstrap JavaScript file, as Bootstrap's JavaScript components depend on jQuery. You can include it with the following line of code:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
```

These scripts should be placed at the end of your `body` tag.
