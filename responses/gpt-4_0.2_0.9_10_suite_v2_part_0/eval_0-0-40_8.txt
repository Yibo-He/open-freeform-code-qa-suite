The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm installations on your Windows system and the ones in your WSL2 environment. 

When you run `npm -v`, the shell is trying to execute the npm script located in your Windows system (`/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm`), which is not compatible with the Linux environment provided by WSL2.

To resolve this issue, you need to adjust your `PATH` environment variable in the WSL2 environment to prioritize the Linux versions of Node.js and npm over the Windows ones. 

You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (depending on which shell you're using):

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

This line will ensure that the directories containing the Linux versions of Node.js and npm are searched before the ones containing the Windows versions.

After adding this line, you need to reload your shell configuration file with the following command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions installed in your WSL2 environment.
