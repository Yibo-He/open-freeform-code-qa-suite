The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside of the Docker container. You need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it can accept connections from any IP.

You can achieve this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should allow you to connect to it from outside the Docker container. 

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server at `localhost:8080` from your host machine.
