The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of factors. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Check your build command:** Make sure your build command is correct in your Vercel settings. It should be `yarn run build` or `npm run build` depending on your package manager.

2. **Check your output directory:** By default, Next.js uses `.next` as the output directory. If you have changed this, you need to update the "Output Directory" field in your Vercel settings to match your custom output directory.

3. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` correctly. If you're using `getServerSideProps`, it might cause issues because Vercel pre-renders pages at build time.

4. **Check your public folder:** If you have a `public` folder in your project, make sure the files you're trying to access are in there. Files in the `public` folder will be served at the root of your domain.

5. **Check your imports:** Make sure you're not importing any modules or packages that can't be compiled into static JavaScript. This includes `fs` and `path` modules.

6. **Check your environment variables:** If you're using environment variables, make sure they are defined in your Vercel settings.

7. **Check your Next.js version:** There might be a bug in the version of Next.js you're using. Try updating to the latest version.

8. **Check the Vercel logs:** The deployment logs on Vercel might give you more information about what's going wrong.

If none of these steps resolve your issue, it might be a good idea to reach out to Vercel support or ask for help on the Next.js GitHub page.
