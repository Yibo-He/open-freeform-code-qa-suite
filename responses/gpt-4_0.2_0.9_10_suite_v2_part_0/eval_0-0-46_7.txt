The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, but it's not there.

You can fix this by providing the correct path to your `tsconfig.json` file in the `parserOptions.project` field of your `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project, and your `.eslintrc.js` file is also in the root directory, you should be able to fix the issue by changing the `parserOptions.project` field to `"./tsconfig.json"`:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different directory, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in a directory named `config`, you would change the `parserOptions.project` field to `"./config/tsconfig.json"`.

After making this change, you should restart your IDE or text editor to ensure the changes are picked up. If you're still seeing the error after making this change and restarting your IDE, there may be another issue at play. In that case, I would recommend checking the ESLint and TypeScript configuration documentation for additional troubleshooting steps.
