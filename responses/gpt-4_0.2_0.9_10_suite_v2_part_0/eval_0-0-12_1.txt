The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not correct. 

Here are a few things you can do to fix this:

1. **Check your credentials**: Make sure that the username and password you are using are correct. The username should be your full email address, and the password should be your Gmail password.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. To resolve this issue, you need to enable "Less secure apps" in your Google account. Here is how you can do it:

    - Go to your Google Account.
    - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
    - On the bottom of the page, in the Less secure app access panel, click Turn on access.
    - If you don't see this setting, your administrator might have turned off less secure app account access.

3. **Use App Passwords**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you may need to use an app password instead of your regular password. Here is how you can generate an app password:

    - Go to your Google Account.
    - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
    - Under "Signing in to Google," click App Passwords. You might need to sign in again.
    - If you don’t see this option, 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account, or set up for security keys only.
    - At the bottom, click Select app and choose the app you’re using.
    - Click Select device and choose the device you’re using.
    - Click Generate.
    - Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
    - Click Done.

Once you have generated your App Password, use it in your script instead of your regular password.

Remember to keep your App Password confidential. Also, you do not need to memorize this password. If you ever need a new one, just generate another one.
