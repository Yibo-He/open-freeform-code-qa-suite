The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and it takes two callback functions as arguments. The first callback is invoked when the position data is available, and the second one is invoked when an error occurs.

In your case, you are only providing the success callback. You should also provide the error callback to handle the case when the user denies the location access. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user allows location access, "Location accessed" will be logged to the console. If the user denies location access, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the browser does not support geolocation at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
