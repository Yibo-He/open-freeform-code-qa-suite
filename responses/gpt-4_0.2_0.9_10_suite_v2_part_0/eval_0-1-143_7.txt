Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to change the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar, then click on `Open Folder` in the `Profile Folder` row.

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css` if it doesn't exist.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor.

5. Paste the following code into the file:

    ```css
    :root {
        --proton-dense-toolbar-vertical-padding: 4px !important;
        --proton-toolbar-vertical-padding: 4px !important;
        --proton-menu-vertical-padding: 4px !important;
    }
    ```

6. Save the file and close it.

7. In Firefox, go to `about:config`.

8. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.

9. Restart Firefox.

This CSS code reduces the vertical padding of the toolbar and menu items. You can adjust the `4px` value to your liking. The `!important` keyword is used to override the default style.

Please note that modifying internal files can lead to unexpected behavior, and you do so at your own risk. Always make a backup of your data before making changes.
