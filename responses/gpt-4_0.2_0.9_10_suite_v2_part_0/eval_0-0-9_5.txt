The error you're encountering is because `req.logout()` is not a function in Express.js by default. It is added by Passport.js when you use it as middleware. 

However, your code seems correct and it should work as expected because you are using Passport.js and it provides the `req.logout()` function. 

The error message you're seeing "Error: req#logout requires a callback function" is not a common error message for Passport.js. It might be possible that some other middleware or library is causing this issue.

As a workaround, you can manually delete the `req.user` object and destroy the session. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        res.redirect("/"); //Inside a callbackâ€¦ bulletproof!
    });
});
```

This code will destroy the session and then redirect the user to the home page. If there's an error during this process, it will be passed to the callback function.

If you still encounter the error, I would recommend checking other parts of your code or middleware that might be interfering with Passport.js.
