The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because the package name is incorrect. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You should be able to install the package with the correct command:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This command will install the `aws-sdk` package and also add it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.
