It's hard to provide a specific solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can follow to debug and fix the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Make sure you have the correct scripts in your `package.json` file. Vercel uses these scripts to build and start your application. Here is an example of what your scripts might look like:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
    }
    ```

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file and folder structure in the `pages` directory should match the URL structure. For example, if you have a page at `pages/posts/[id].js`, you should be able to access it at `yourwebsite.com/posts/1`.

3. **Check your public directory:** If you have a `public` directory in your project, make sure the files you're trying to access are in the correct location. Files in the `public` directory can be accessed at the root of your domain. For example, if you have a file at `public/image.jpg`, you can access it at `yourwebsite.com/image.jpg`.

4. **Check your server-side rendering code:** If you're using server-side rendering (SSR), make sure your server-side code doesn't rely on any client-side features, like `window` or `document`. These features are not available during SSR.

5. **Check your API routes:** If you're using API routes, make sure they're set up correctly. API routes should be in the `pages/api` directory and they should export a default function that handles the request and response.

6. **Check your error logs:** Vercel provides detailed error logs that can help you debug the issue. You can access these logs from your Vercel dashboard.

If you're still having issues, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your project and sharing it. This will make it easier for others to help you debug the issue.
