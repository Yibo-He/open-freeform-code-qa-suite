The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you could check if you're experiencing issues:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the loading state to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Response**: Check the server response by using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL, Apollo Studio, or GraphQL Playground. You can use the same query to see if you're getting the expected response.

3. **Apollo Client Setup**: Ensure that the Apollo Client is set up correctly. The URI you provided seems to be a sandbox environment, which might not be available all the time. Try to replace it with your own GraphQL server URI.

4. **Error Handling**: The `error` object from `useQuery` should contain information about what went wrong. If there's an error, it should be logged in the console. If you're not seeing any error, it might be that the error is not being handled or displayed correctly.

5. **React Native Debugger**: Use React Native Debugger to debug network requests. It allows you to see the requests and responses of your GraphQL queries.

6. **Apollo Client Version**: Ensure that the version of Apollo Client you're using is compatible with your GraphQL server.

If all these checks don't help, you might want to create a minimal reproducible example and ask for help in the Apollo community or on StackOverflow.
