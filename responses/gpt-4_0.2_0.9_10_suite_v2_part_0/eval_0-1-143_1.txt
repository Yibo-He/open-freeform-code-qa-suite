Yes, you can modify the user interface of Firefox by creating and editing a `userChrome.css` file in your Firefox profile directory. Here's how you can reduce the spacing between menu items:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:support` in the address bar, then press Enter.
2. In the `Application Basics` section, click on `Open Directory` next to `Profile Directory`. A new window with your profile files will open.
3. In this directory, create a new folder and name it `chrome`.
4. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`.
5. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and paste the following code:

```css
/* Reduce Spacing in Menus for Firefox Proton */
:root {
  --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
}
```

6. Save the file and close it.
7. Now, you need to enable the usage of this file in Firefox. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.
8. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.
9. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.
10. Restart Firefox to see the changes.

This CSS code reduces the padding around menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the padding values (4px 8px in this case) to your liking. The first value is the vertical padding (top and bottom) and the second value is the horizontal padding (left and right).
