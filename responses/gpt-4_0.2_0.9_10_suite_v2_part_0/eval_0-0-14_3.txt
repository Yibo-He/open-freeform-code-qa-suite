Sure, I can help with that. The issue might be related to the `valuePropName` prop. It's used to specify which prop on the child component will get the Form value. For the Switch component, the prop should be `checked`. Here is the revised version of your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

In this revised version, I removed the `noStyle` prop from the `Form.Item` because it might be causing the issue. The `noStyle` prop should be used when you don't want to create a new field container, which is not the case here.
