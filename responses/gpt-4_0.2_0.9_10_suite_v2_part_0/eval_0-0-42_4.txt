Sure, here's how you can update your code to use `connect-mongo` v4:

```javascript
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

...

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI })
}));
```

Please note that in `connect-mongo` v4, you no longer need to pass the session to `require('connect-mongo')`. Instead, you can directly require it and use the `create` method to create a new store. The `mongooseConnection` option has been replaced with `mongoUrl`, where you can directly pass your MongoDB connection string.
