The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're having issues:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device or emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could be the issue.

2. **Server Availability**: Ensure that the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can check this by visiting the URL in your web browser.

3. **Correct GraphQL Query**: Verify that your GraphQL query is correct. You can do this by running the query in a GraphQL playground or similar tool against your server.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **Error Handling**: You might be getting an error but not seeing it. Try logging the error object to see if there's any useful information:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there's a known issue where network requests can hang indefinitely. Try disabling it to see if that's the issue.

7. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to try creating a minimal reproduction of the issue and asking for help on the Apollo Client GitHub issues page or a similar forum.
