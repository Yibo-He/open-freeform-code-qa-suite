The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because the package name is incorrect. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript is `aws-sdk`.

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, make sure your network connection is stable and that the npm registry is accessible from your network.
