The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find your `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, but it's not there.

You can fix this by providing the correct path to your `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Find out the relative path from your `.eslintrc.js` file to your `tsconfig.json` file. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory called `config`, the relative path would be `../tsconfig.json`.

2. Replace the value of the `project` property in the `parserOptions` object in your `.eslintrc.js` file with the relative path you found in step 1.

Here's what your updated `.eslintrc.js` file might look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json", // replace this with the actual relative path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Save the changes and restart your editor. The error should be gone now. If it's still there, double-check the relative path and make sure it's correct.
