Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're having issues with the data loading:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device or emulator has a proper internet connection. You can test this by trying to fetch data from another API or loading a webpage.

2. **API Endpoint**: Ensure that the API endpoint you're using is correct and working. You can test the API endpoint by pasting it into a web browser or using a tool like Postman.

3. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

4. **React Native Version**: Similarly, there might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **Error Handling**: Add a `catch` block to handle any errors that might occur during the query. This can help you identify if there's an issue with the query itself.

6. **GraphQL Query**: Make sure your GraphQL query is correct. You can test your query in the GraphQL playground.

7. **Server Response**: Check the server response. The server might be returning an error or unexpected data.

8. **React Native Debugger**: Use React Native Debugger to inspect the network request and response. This can help you identify if there's an issue with the request or response.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about the error you're experiencing.
