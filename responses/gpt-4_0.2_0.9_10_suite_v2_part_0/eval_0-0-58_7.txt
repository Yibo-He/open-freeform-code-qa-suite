The `EINTEGRITY` error is caused by a discrepancy between the expected and actual checksum of a package. This can occur due to various reasons such as network issues, npm cache corruption, or changes in the package.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear npm cache**: The npm cache might be corrupted. You can clear it using the command `npm cache clean --force`.

2. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by deleting the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm install` again.

3. **Update npm**: The issue might be due to a bug in your current version of npm. You can update npm using the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.

4. **Check network connection**: If your network connection is unstable, it might cause issues during package download. Try switching to a different network or using a VPN.

5. **Use a different package registry**: If the issue persists, it might be due to a problem with the npm registry. You can switch to a different registry such as Yarn or cnpm.

6. **Check package.json**: There might be an issue with the package itself. Check if the version specified in your `package.json` file is correct. If the package has been updated recently, you might need to update the version in your `package.json` file.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
