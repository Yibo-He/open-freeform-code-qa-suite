The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the npm registry. This is because the correct name of the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You should replace `aws-sdk-js` with `aws-sdk` in your `package.json` file or in the command line when you install the package.

So, instead of running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk-js
```

You should run:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue.
