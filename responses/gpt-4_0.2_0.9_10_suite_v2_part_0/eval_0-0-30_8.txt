Yes, there is an adapter for React 17. It's called `enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm i --save enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated
```

Then, you can adapt your import code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This will configure Enzyme to use the adapter for React 17.
