Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` next to `Profile Folder`.

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist already.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css` if it doesn't exist already.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and add the following code:

    ```css
    /* Reduce spacing on context menus */
    :root {
        --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
    }
    ```

5. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This will reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox. If you want to adjust the spacing further, you can modify the `4px 8px` values in the code above. The first value is the vertical padding (top and bottom) and the second value is the horizontal padding (left and right).

Please note that starting from Firefox 69, you need to enable the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` setting in `about:config` for `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` to work. To do this:

1. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.

2. Click `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

3. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.

4. If the value is `false`, click on the toggle button to set it to `true`.

5. Restart Firefox.

Please be aware that modifying internal files can affect the stability and security of Firefox, so proceed with caution.
