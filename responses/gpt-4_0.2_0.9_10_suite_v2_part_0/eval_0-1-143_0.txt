Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to reduce the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` in the `Profile Folder` row.

2. In your profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If it already exists, open it.

4. Paste the following CSS into the `userChrome.css` file:

```css
/* Reduce Menu and URL Bar padding */
:root {
  --proton-dense-toolbar-vertical-padding: 2px !important;
  --proton-toolbar-vertical-padding: 2px !important;
  --proton-tab-block-margin: 0px !important;
  --proton-tab-block-padding: 0px !important;
}

/* Reduce padding on bookmarks toolbar items */
#PersonalToolbar .bookmark-item {
  padding-block: 2px !important;
}
```

5. Save the `userChrome.css` file and close it.

6. Now, you need to enable the usage of this file in Firefox. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.

7. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

8. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

9. Restart Firefox to see the changes.

This CSS reduces the padding of the toolbar and the bookmarks toolbar items. You can adjust the padding values according to your preference.
