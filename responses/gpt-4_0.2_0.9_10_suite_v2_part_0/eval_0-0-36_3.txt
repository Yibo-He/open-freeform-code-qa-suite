```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    const reloadPage = () => {
        router.replace(router.asPath);
    }
}
```

In the above code, `router.replace(router.asPath)` will trigger a client-side reload in Next.js. The `router.asPath` gives the path string, including the query, as shown in the browser. By replacing the current path with the same path, it forces Next.js to reload the page on the client side.
