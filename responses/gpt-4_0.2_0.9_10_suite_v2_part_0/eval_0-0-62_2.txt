The error message is indicating that you are using a non-primitive value (in this case, an object) as a key in your `v-for` loop. Vue.js requires that keys be primitive values, such as strings or numbers.

In your case, `comment` is an object, which is why you are seeing this error. If your `comment` object has a unique identifier, such as an `id`, you should use that as the key instead.

Here's how you can fix it:

```html
<template>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>{{ story.title }}</h2>
        <p>Score: {{ story.score }}</p>
        <p>{{ story.url }}</p>
        <div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
          <div class="comment-wrap">
                <div class="comment-block">
                    <p class="comment-text">{{ comment.text }}</p>
                    <div class="bottom-comment">
                        <div class="comment-author">{{ comment.by }}</div>
                        <div class="comment-date">{{ comment.time }}</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```

In this example, I've assumed that your `comment` object has an `id` property. If it doesn't, you'll need to use a different property that is unique for each comment.
