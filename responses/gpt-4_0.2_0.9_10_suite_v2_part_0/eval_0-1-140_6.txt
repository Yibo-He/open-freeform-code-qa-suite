Font Awesome 5 has a few changes in the way it's used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now divided into different styles like "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". Also, the `font-weight` needs to be specified.

Here's how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* or "Font Awesome 5 Pro" if you're using the Pro version */
  font-weight: 900; /* For solid style */
}
```

The `font-weight` can be `400` for regular style, `300` for light style, `900` for solid style, and `400` for brands style. Make sure you're using the correct unicode for the icon you want to display. You can find these unicodes on the Font Awesome website.

Also, ensure that you have properly included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
