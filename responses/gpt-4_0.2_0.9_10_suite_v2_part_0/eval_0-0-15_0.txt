Sure, the issue is that you are mocking the API as an object, but you are trying to use it as a class. You should mock it as a class instead. Here is the revised version of your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the API as a class. Now, you can use `const api = new API()` without any errors.
