Sure, you can define an array of a specific object type like this:

```typescript
type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
};

bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

In this code, `Product` is a type that represents an object with `name`, `price`, and `description` properties. `Product[]` is an array of `Product` objects. 

If you want to define the type inline without creating a separate `Product` type, you can do it like this:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

In this case, `{name: string, price: number, description: string}[]` is an array of objects, each with `name`, `price`, and `description` properties.
