In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons in CSS has changed slightly. The `font-family` is now specific to the style of the icon. Here's how you can update your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Change this to your specific Font Awesome style */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this line. It's necessary for Font Awesome 5 */
}
```

The `font-family` can be one of the following, depending on the style of the icon you want to use:

- "Font Awesome 5 Free" for solid, regular, or brands style.
- "Font Awesome 5 Pro" for light, regular, solid, or duotone style (Pro license required).

The `font-weight` should be one of the following, again depending on the style:

- 300 for Light
- 400 for Regular
- 900 for Solid

If you're using a brand icon, you should use "Font Awesome 5 Brands" as the `font-family` and you don't need to specify a `font-weight`.

Please note that the unicode for the icon (`\f107` in your case) may have changed in Font Awesome 5. You can look up the correct unicode in the [Font Awesome 5 Icons List](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free).
