Your code seems fine, but there are a few things that might be causing the issue:

1. **Network Issues**: The Apollo Client might not be able to reach the server due to network issues. Check your internet connection and try again. Also, try to access the server URL directly in your browser to see if it's up and running.

2. **Server Issues**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. If you have control over the server, check its logs for any errors. If you don't, try to contact the server administrator.

3. **CORS Issues**: The server might not be set up to accept requests from your origin. This is a common issue when making requests from a local development environment to a remote server. If you have control over the server, make sure it's set up to accept requests from your origin. If you don't, you might need to set up a proxy server.

4. **Apollo Client Configuration**: There might be an issue with your Apollo Client configuration. Try to create a minimal setup to see if the issue persists. Also, make sure you're using the correct versions of Apollo Client and its dependencies.

5. **React Native Version**: You're using React Native version 0.68.1, which doesn't exist at the moment. The latest version is 0.67.3. This might be a typo, but if it's not, it could be causing the issue.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to consider using a different GraphQL client or even fetching the data manually using `fetch` or `axios` to see if the issue is specific to Apollo Client.
