You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This is because Bootstrap uses this pseudo-element to create the arrow. Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS code will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is expanded and when it is collapsed. If you want different colors for each state, just change the color in the corresponding CSS rule.
