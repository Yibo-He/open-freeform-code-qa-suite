The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with the Gmail SMTP server are not correct. 

Here are a few things you can do to fix this issue:

1. **Check your username and password**: Make sure that the username (email) and password you are using are correct. The username should be your full email address.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. To fix this, you need to enable "Less secure apps" in your Google account. You can do this by going to your Google account settings, then to "Security", and then enable "Less secure apps". Note that this option is not available if 2-Step Verification is enabled on your account.

3. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled on your Google account, you will need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. You can generate an App Password by going to your Google account settings, then to "Security", and then "App Passwords". 

Replace the 'pass' field in your code with the generated App Password.

```javascript
auth: {
  user: 'haideryaqoobengr@gmail.com',
  pass: 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD'
}
```

Remember, it's not a good practice to hard code your credentials in your source code. Consider using environment variables or some sort of configuration that is not committed with your code.
