The error you're seeing is because `req.logout()` is being called without a callback function. However, in your case, you don't actually need a callback function because you're not doing anything after logging out the user other than redirecting them to the home page.

The `req.logout()` function is provided by Passport.js and is used to log out a user. It will remove the `req.user` property and clear the login session (if any).

Here's the revised code:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log('Error : Failed to destroy the session during logout.', err);
        }
        req.user = null;
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

In the revised code, I've added `req.session.destroy()` to ensure the session is destroyed when the user logs out. This is a good practice to follow when logging out users to prevent any potential session-related issues. The `req.user = null;` line is added to ensure that the user information is removed from the request object.
