Sure, I can help you with that. You can use the `group-hover` utility to apply styles on hover. Here's how you can modify your code to create an animation when hovering over the link:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300">
    Link
    <span class="block w-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, the width of the span is initially set to 0 (`w-0`) and when you hover over the link (the parent element with the `group` class), the width of the span will transition to full (`group-hover:w-full`). The `transition-all` and `duration-500` classes ensure that this change in width happens smoothly over 500 milliseconds.

Please note that the `group-hover` variant is not enabled by default for all utilities in Tailwind CSS. If it doesn't work, you might need to enable it in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    }
  }
}
```

This will enable the `group-hover` variant for the `width` utility.
