Sure, the issue here is that you're trying to instantiate a mock that's not a class. You should mock the class itself, not an instance of it. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` creates a mock function that, when called, will return an object with a `someMethod` function. This way, when you call `new API()`, it will return a new object with the `someMethod` function, just like the real `API` class would.
