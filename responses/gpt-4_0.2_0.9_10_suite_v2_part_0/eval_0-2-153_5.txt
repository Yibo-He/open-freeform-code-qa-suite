You can use the Tailwind CSS utility classes to apply a border only to the top of an element. 

The `border-t` class applies a border to the top edge of an element. The `border-blue-900` class applies a blue color to the border. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

In this code, `border-t` applies a border to the top edge of the div, and `border-blue-900` sets the color of the border to blue.
