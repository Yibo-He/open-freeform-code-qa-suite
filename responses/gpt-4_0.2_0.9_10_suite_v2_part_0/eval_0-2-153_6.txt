You can use the Tailwind CSS utility classes to apply a border only to the top. The `border-t` class applies a border to the top edge of an element. You can also specify the color of the border using the `border-{color}` classes.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

In this code, `border-t` applies a border to the top edge, and `border-blue-900` sets the color of the border to blue.
