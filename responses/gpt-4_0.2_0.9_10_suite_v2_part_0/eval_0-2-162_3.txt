The blanks in your code should be filled with "scroll" and "style.backgroundColor" respectively. Here is the completed code:

```javascript
const [red, green, blue] = [69, 111, 225]
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1')

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  let y = 1 + (window.scrollY || window.pageYOffset) / 150
  y = y < 1 ? 1 : y // ensure y is always >= 1 (due to Safari's elastic scroll)
  const [r, g, b] = [red/y, green/y, blue/y].map(Math.round)
  section1.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`
})
```

This code will change the background color of the element with class 'section1' as you scroll down the page. The color will gradually change from the initial RGB color (69, 111, 225) to lighter shades.
