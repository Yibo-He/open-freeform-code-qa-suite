The error log indicates that Python is not found in your PATH. Node-gyp, which is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, requires Python 2.7 (v3.x.x is not supported).

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7, and add it to your PATH, npm config set python python2.7
2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 (Express version works well)
3. If you have multiple Python versions on your system, you can target a specific Python version by setting the --python switch to point to the Python executable.

If the Python installation is successful but the error persists, you can force node-gyp to use the specific python version by setting the npm config variable python:

```shell
npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7
```

If you are using Windows, you might find the windows-build-tools npm package to be helpful. It installs Python 2.7 and all the required compile tools. You can install it globally by running:

```shell
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

After installation, npm will automatically be able to find Python and the build tools.
