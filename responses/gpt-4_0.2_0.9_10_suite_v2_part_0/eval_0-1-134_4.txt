It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that provides abbreviations for faster HTML/CSS coding. 

For example, if you type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be because:

1. You're not using a text editor that supports Emmet. Emmet is built-in in editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and others. If you're using a different editor, you might need to install Emmet separately.

2. Your text editor doesn't have Emmet enabled. Check your editor's settings to make sure Emmet is turned on.

3. You're not pressing the right key to expand the abbreviation. In most editors, this is the `Tab` key, but it could be different in yours.

4. There might be an issue with your specific editor. If you're using Visual Studio Code, for example, there's a known issue where Emmet doesn't work in .jsx files by default. You can fix this by adding the following to your settings:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascriptreact"
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
