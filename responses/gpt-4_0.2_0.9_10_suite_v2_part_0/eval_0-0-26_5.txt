The ESLint error you're seeing is because the anonymous function you're using in the `render` property doesn't have a `displayName`. This is a rule in ESLint to help make your code more readable and maintainable.

You can fix this by either disabling the rule for that line, or by giving the function a name. Here are both solutions:

**1. Disabling the rule for that line:**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => (
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

**2. Giving the function a name:**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: function renderGroup(text) {
        return <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      },
    }
  ]
```

In the second solution, the function `renderGroup` now has a `displayName` of "renderGroup", which satisfies the ESLint rule.
