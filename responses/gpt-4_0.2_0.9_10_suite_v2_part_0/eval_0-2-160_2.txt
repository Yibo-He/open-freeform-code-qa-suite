The `sourceMap` option in your `tsconfig.json` file is a compiler option that determines whether or not source maps should be generated for your TypeScript files.

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are extremely useful during development for debugging purposes, as they allow you to view and debug your original TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools, even though the browser is actually running the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, then these source map files will not be generated. This means that if you try to debug your code in the browser, you will only see the compiled JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript code.

However, this change will not affect the actual functionality of your Angular app in any way. It will only affect your ability to debug the TypeScript code in the browser.

If you're not seeing any changes, it's likely because you're not currently debugging your code, or your build process is not set up to include the source maps in the output.
