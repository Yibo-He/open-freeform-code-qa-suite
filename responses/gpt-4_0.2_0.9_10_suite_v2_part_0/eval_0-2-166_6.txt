In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you would in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style. 

So, if you want to style direct children `div` of a parent `div` with class `section`, you would apply your styles directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the direct children `div` of the parent `div` with class `section`.

Remember, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It doesn't use traditional CSS selectors, but instead uses utility classes to directly style elements.
