It's hard to pinpoint the exact issue without seeing your codebase, but here are some general steps you can follow to debug and potentially fix the issue:

1. **Check your build command:** Make sure your build command in Vercel is correct. It should be `yarn run build` or `npm run build` depending on your package manager.

2. **Check your output directory:** By default, Next.js generates the output to the `.next` directory. However, Vercel expects the output to be in the `out` directory. If you have changed the output directory, you can specify it in the Vercel settings.

3. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you are using dynamic routes, make sure you are using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` correctly. If you are using `getServerSideProps`, it might cause issues because Vercel deploys Next.js as a static site by default.

4. **Check your public directory:** If you have a `public` directory in your project, make sure all your static assets are there. Vercel serves static files from the `public` directory.

5. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file. If you have dependencies that are not listed, it might cause issues when Vercel tries to install them.

6. **Check your environment variables:** If you are using environment variables, make sure they are defined in the Vercel settings. Also, remember that environment variables are not available at build time by default in Next.js. You might need to prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to make them available.

7. **Check your logs:** Check the build logs in Vercel. They might give you more information about what's going wrong.

If none of these steps help, you might need to share more information about your project or contact Vercel support.
