You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button::after` pseudo-element in your CSS. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow in the Bootstrap accordion.

Here is an example of how you can change the color to green:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* Bootstrap 4 */
    color: green;
}

/* or */

.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* Bootstrap 5 */
    color: green;
}
```

In Bootstrap 5, the arrow is rotated using a transform when the accordion item is open, so you need to use the `:not(.collapsed)` selector to target the arrow when the accordion item is open.

Remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, or else the Bootstrap CSS may override your custom styles.

If you're using a CSS preprocessor like SCSS or LESS, you can nest these styles inside your `.accordion-button` styles for more maintainable code.
