Sure, the issue here is that you're mocking the API class to return an object, but then you're trying to use the `new` keyword with it, which is causing the error. You should mock the API class to return a function that creates an object. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a function that creates an object
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, you can use `const api = new API()` without any issues.
