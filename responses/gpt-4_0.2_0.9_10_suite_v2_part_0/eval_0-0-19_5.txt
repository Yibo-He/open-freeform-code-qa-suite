The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is likely because the package does not exist or the package name is incorrect.

The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue.
