In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons in CSS has changed slightly. You need to specify the style of the icon you want to use in the `font-family` property. The styles can be `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, or `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. 

Also, the `font-weight` property is now used to determine whether the icon is solid (`900`), regular (`400`), or light (`300`). 

Here's how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Change this to the style you want */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this line. Change the value to 400 for regular, 300 for light */
}
```

Please note that the unicode `\f107` corresponds to the "angle-down" icon in Font Awesome. If you want to use a different icon, you need to look up its unicode in the Font Awesome 5 documentation.
