In your case, you can use the `router.reload()` function to trigger a client-side reload. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    router.reload();
}
```

This will reload the current page and `getInitialProps` will be called on the client-side.
