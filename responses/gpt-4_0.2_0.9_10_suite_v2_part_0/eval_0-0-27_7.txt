The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you might want to check if you're having issues:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. The Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could cause the loading state to persist.

2. **Server Availability**: The server at `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` should be up and running. If the server is down, the client won't be able to fetch data.

3. **Correct GraphQL Query**: Make sure the GraphQL query `EXCHANGE_RATES` is correct and the server supports it. If the query is incorrect or not supported by the server, it could lead to an error or persistent loading state.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **Debugging**: Use tools like [Apollo Client Devtools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/developer-tooling/) for Chrome to inspect your Apollo Client cache, queries, and mutations to help debug the issue.

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider posting this issue in the Apollo Client GitHub repository or on Stack Overflow for more specific help.
