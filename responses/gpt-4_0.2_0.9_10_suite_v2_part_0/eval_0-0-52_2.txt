Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can manually uninstall a package using npm or yarn.

If you are using npm, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

If you are using yarn, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

After running these commands, the package will be removed from your `node_modules` directory and the package name will be removed from the `package.json` file.

Remember to replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove.
