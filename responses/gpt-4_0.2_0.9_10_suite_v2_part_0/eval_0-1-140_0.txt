Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", but it depends on the style you want to use. The styles available are: `fas` (Solid), `far` (Regular), `fal` (Light), `fab` (Brands).

Also, the unicode for the same icon may have changed from version 4 to 5. You can check the unicode for your icon in the Font Awesome 5 website.

Assuming you want to use the solid style for the icon, and the unicode for the icon is `f107`, the CSS would be:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* for solid style */
  font-weight: 900; /* required for correct display with Font Awesome 5 */
}
```

If you want to use another style, replace `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` with `"Font Awesome 5 Brands"` for brands, or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` for light and regular (if you have the Pro version). The `font-weight` should be `400` for regular and light styles, and `900` for solid and brands.
