The issue you're experiencing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu and those installed in your Windows system. The `whereis` command shows that the system is trying to run npm from the Windows directory (`/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm`), which is not compatible with the Linux environment.

To resolve this issue, you need to remove the Windows PATH from the WSL environment. Here are the steps:

1. Open your bash profile file. If you're using bash, it's usually `~/.bashrc`. If you're using zsh, it's `~/.zshrc`. You can open it with a text editor like vim or nano:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin"
   ```

   This line sets the PATH to only include directories within the WSL environment, excluding the Windows directories.

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and then `Enter`.

4. Reload your bash profile:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Now, check the versions of Node.js and npm again:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

You should now see the correct versions that you installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment.
