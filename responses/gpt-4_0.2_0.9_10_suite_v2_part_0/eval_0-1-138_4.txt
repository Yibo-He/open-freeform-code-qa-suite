Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode by using the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature in CSS. This feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system to use a light or dark color theme.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```css
/* Light mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the background color of the body will be white and the text color will be black if the user's system is in light mode. If the system is in dark mode, the background color will be black and the text color will be white.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 or later. For more information, you can check the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
