The ESLint error you're seeing is because the anonymous function you're using in the `render` property doesn't have a `displayName`. This is a rule in ESLint to help with debugging and testing.

You can solve this by either disabling the rule for that line or by giving the function a name. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Disable the rule for that line**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => (
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

**Option 2: Give the function a name**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: function renderCount(text) {
        return <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      },
    }
  ]
```

In the second option, the function `renderCount` now has a `displayName` by default, which is the function name itself.
