Enzyme doesn't officially support React 17 yet. However, there is an unofficial adapter available that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`.

First, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17 until the official support is released.
