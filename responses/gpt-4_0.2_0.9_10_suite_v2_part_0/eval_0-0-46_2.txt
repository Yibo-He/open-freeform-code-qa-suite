The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` suggests that ESLint is having trouble finding your `tsconfig.json` file. This is likely because the `project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file is set to `"tsconfig.json"`, which is a relative path. ESLint is trying to find `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as the file it's linting, but it's not there.

To fix this, you need to provide an absolute path to your `tsconfig.json` file. You can use the `__dirname` global variable in Node.js, which gives you the directory name of the current module, to construct this path.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: path.resolve(__dirname, './tsconfig.json'),
    sourceType: 'module',
  },
  // ...
};
```

This will tell ESLint to look for `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, regardless of where the file being linted is located. 

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, adjust the path accordingly. For example, if `tsconfig.json` is one level up, you would use `'../tsconfig.json'` instead of `'./tsconfig.json'`.

After making this change, restart your IDE or editor to ensure the changes are picked up.
