It's hard to give a precise answer without seeing your code, but I can provide some general advice that might help you troubleshoot the issue.

1. **Check your build command:** Make sure your build command in Vercel is correct. It should be `yarn run build` or `npm run build` depending on your package manager.

2. **Check your output directory:** By default, Next.js generates the output to the `.next` directory. If you have changed this in your `package.json` or somewhere else, you need to update this in Vercel settings too.

3. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` correctly. If you're using `getServerSideProps`, it might cause issues because Vercel pre-renders pages at build time.

4. **Check your public directory:** If you have a `public` directory in your project, make sure all your static assets are there. Files in `public` can be referenced from the root of the project like `/logo.png`.

5. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are listed in `package.json` and there's no local dependency that can't be resolved in the Vercel environment.

6. **Check your environment variables:** If you're using environment variables, make sure they are defined in Vercel. You can define them in the Vercel dashboard under Settings -> Environment Variables.

7. **Check the logs:** Vercel provides build logs. Check them for any error messages.

8. **Create a `next.config.js` file:** Although you mentioned you don't have a `next.config.js` file, it might be helpful to create one. This file is used to customize the behavior of Next.js. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
};
```

This sets the build target to `serverless`, which is what Vercel uses.

If none of these suggestions help, I would recommend creating a minimal reproduction of your project and deploying that to Vercel. This can help you isolate the issue.
