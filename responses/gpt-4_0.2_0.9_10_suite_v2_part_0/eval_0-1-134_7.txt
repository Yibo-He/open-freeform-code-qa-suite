It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

For example, if you type `.classname` and hit `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If it's not working for you, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Emmet is not installed or enabled**: Check if your text editor has Emmet installed and enabled. If not, you might need to install it. For example, if you're using Visual Studio Code, Emmet is built-in and enabled by default. For other editors like Sublime Text or Atom, you might need to install it manually.

2. **You're not in an HTML file**: Emmet usually only works in HTML files. Make sure your file is saved with an .html extension and your text editor recognizes it as an HTML file.

3. **You're not hitting the right key**: After typing the Emmet abbreviation (like `.classname`), you need to hit `Tab` to expand it. If you're hitting a different key, it might not work.

4. **There's a conflict with another plugin**: If you have other plugins installed, they might interfere with Emmet. Try disabling other plugins to see if that fixes the problem.

If none of the above solutions work, please provide more information about your setup (like which text editor you're using) so I can give a more specific answer.
