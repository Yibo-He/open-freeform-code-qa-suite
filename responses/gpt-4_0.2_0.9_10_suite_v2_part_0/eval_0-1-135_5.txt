Yes, there is a known issue with Safari and flexbox where images with `height: auto` can be stretched. This is because Safari has a different interpretation of the flexbox specification. 

To fix this issue, you can add `align-self: flex-start` to the image. This will align the image to the start of the flex container, preventing it from stretching.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make your images display correctly in Safari.
