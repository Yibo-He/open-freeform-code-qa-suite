The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works for single line text. If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you will need to use some additional CSS.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, `line-clamp-1` is a utility class in TailwindCSS v2.2.0 and above that limits the content to 1 line and adds an ellipsis if the content overflows.

If you are using a version of TailwindCSS that does not support the `line-clamp` utility, you can add the following CSS to your styles:

```css
.line-clamp-1 {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 1;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Then you can use the `line-clamp-1` class as shown in the previous example.
