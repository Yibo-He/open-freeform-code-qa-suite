Sure, you can use intersection types (`&`) to combine the two types. Here is the corrected TypeScript code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit has a numeric property and each color has a boolean property.
