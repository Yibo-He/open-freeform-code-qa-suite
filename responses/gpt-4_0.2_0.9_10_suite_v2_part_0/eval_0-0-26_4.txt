The ESLint error you're seeing is due to the anonymous function you're using in the `render` property. ESLint is configured to enforce a rule that all components must have a `displayName` for better debugging.

To fix this, you can either disable the rule for this line or give a name to the function. Here's how you can do both:

**1. Disabling the rule for this line:**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => (
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

**2. Giving a name to the function:**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: function RenderCountForCountry(text) {
        return <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      },
    }
  ]
```

In the second example, `RenderCountForCountry` is the name of the function, which will be used as the `displayName`.
