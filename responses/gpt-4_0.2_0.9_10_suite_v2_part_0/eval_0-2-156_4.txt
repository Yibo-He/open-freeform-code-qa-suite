It seems like you want to align the "Stop Game" button with the "Begin Game" button. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Use CSS Flexbox:** You can use CSS Flexbox to align the buttons. Wrap the buttons in a container and apply `display: flex;` to it. This will align the buttons in a row by default. You can control the spacing between the buttons using `justify-content: space-between;` or `justify-content: space-around;`.

2. **Use CSS Grid:** Another option is to use CSS Grid. Similar to Flexbox, wrap the buttons in a container and apply `display: grid;` to it. You can then use `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);` to create two equal columns for the buttons.

3. **Use Positioning:** If you want more control over the exact position of the buttons, you can use CSS positioning. For example, you can set `position: absolute;` on the buttons and then use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position them. Note that this will take the buttons out of the normal document flow, which can sometimes cause layout issues.

Here is an example of how you might modify your HTML to use Flexbox:

```html
<div id="buttonContainer" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <div id="GameStopped">
    <button id="StartBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="gameStarted=true;">Begin Game</button>
    <div class="Status">Click Begin Game to start</div>
  </div>
  <div id="GameRunning">
    <button id="StopBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="self.close()">Stop Game</button>
    <div id="Status" class="Status"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `#buttonContainer` div is a new container that wraps the buttons. It uses Flexbox to align the buttons in a row and space them apart. You would need to add corresponding CSS in your `style.css` file to style the `#buttonContainer` div.

Remember to adjust the layout according to your needs. You might need to adjust other elements on your page to accommodate these changes.
