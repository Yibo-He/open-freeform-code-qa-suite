From your HTML code, it seems like the "Begin Game" and "Stop Game" buttons are in different divs (`GameStopped` and `GameRunning` respectively). This could be causing the alignment issue.

Here are a few suggestions to fix this:

1. **Place both buttons in the same div**: This will ensure that they are in the same container and can be styled together. You can then use CSS to position them as needed.

```html
<div id="GameControls">
  <button id="StartBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="gameStarted=true;">Begin Game</button>
  <button id="StopBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="self.close()">Stop Game</button>
</div>
```

2. **Use CSS Flexbox or Grid**: These are powerful layout models that allow you to control the alignment, direction, order, and size of boxes. For example, with Flexbox:

```css
#GameControls {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* or 'space-around' or 'center' etc. */
}
```

3. **Use CSS Positioning**: If you need more control, you can use CSS positioning properties (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`) along with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` properties to position your elements. For example:

```css
#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}
```

Remember to adjust these suggestions according to your specific layout and design needs.
