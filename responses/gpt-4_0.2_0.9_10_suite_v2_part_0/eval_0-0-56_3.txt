The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This makes it inaccessible from outside the container, even though the port is correctly published.

To solve this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it can accept connections from any IP. You can do this by modifying the `server` configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

Now, when you run `npm run vite` inside your Docker container, it should be accessible from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
