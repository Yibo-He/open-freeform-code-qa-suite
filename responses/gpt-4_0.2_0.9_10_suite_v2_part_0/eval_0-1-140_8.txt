In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons in CSS has changed slightly. You need to specify the style of the icon in the `font-family` property (either `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, or `Font Awesome 5 Pro`), and you also need to add the `font-weight` property.

Here's how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* or "Font Awesome 5 Brands", or "Font Awesome 5 Pro" */
  font-weight: 900; /* "Font Awesome 5 Free" uses weights 900 for solid, 400 for regular, and 300 for light. */
}
```

Please note that the unicode for the icon (`\f107` in your case) might have changed from Font Awesome 4 to 5. You can look up the correct unicode for your icon in the [Font Awesome 5 Icons List](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free).
