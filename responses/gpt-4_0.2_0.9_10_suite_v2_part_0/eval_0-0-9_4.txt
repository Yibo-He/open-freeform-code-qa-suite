The error message you're seeing is because `req.logout()` is being called without a callback function. However, in Passport.js, `req.logout()` doesn't actually require a callback function. The error might be due to something else in your code.

The `req.logout()` function is used to log the user out and it should work fine in your `/logout` route. Here is the revised `/logout` route:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

If you're still seeing the error, it might be due to the user not being authenticated when trying to access the `/logout` route. You can add a check to see if the user is authenticated before calling `req.logout()`:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        req.logout();
    }
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

This will ensure that `req.logout()` is only called when the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, it will simply redirect to the home page.
