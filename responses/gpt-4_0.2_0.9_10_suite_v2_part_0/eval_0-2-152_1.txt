You need to call the `toast` method with the `show` argument on your toast element to make it visible. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This line of code will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event (like a button click), you can put this line inside an event handler.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires the Bootstrap's JavaScript file to work properly. 

Here is an example of how to include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to place the script tags just before the closing `</body>` tag.
