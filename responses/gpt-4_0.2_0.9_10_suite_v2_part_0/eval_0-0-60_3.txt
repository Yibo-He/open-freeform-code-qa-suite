The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `popper.js` for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns. You need to install `popper.js` in your project.

You can install it using npm or yarn:

**npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing, you need to import it in your file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're using Bootstrap with React, you might want to consider using `react-popper` instead, which is a wrapper around `popper.js` for use with React.

**npm:**

```bash
npm install react-popper --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add react-popper
```

Then, you can import it in your file:

```javascript
import { Popper } from 'react-popper';
```

Remember to restart your development server after installing new dependencies.
