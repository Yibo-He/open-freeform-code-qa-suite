Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the child combinator (`>`). 

Tailwind CSS works by adding utility classes to HTML elements. If you want to style direct children of a `div` with a class of `section`, you would need to add the necessary classes to those child `div` elements directly.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes added directly -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-lg">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` and `text-lg` are Tailwind CSS utility classes that style the direct children of the `div` with the class `section`.

If you need to apply styles to elements based on their parent, you might need to use JavaScript or a preprocessor like Sass or Less in addition to Tailwind CSS.
