The issue you're experiencing could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Vercel uses the `build` script in your `package.json` to build your application. Make sure it's correctly set up. Usually, it should be something like this:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "next dev",
      "build": "next build",
      "start": "next start"
    }
    ```

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file name should be wrapped with square brackets like `[id].js` for dynamic routes.

3. **Check your import/exports:** Make sure you're not using `export { default } from '...'` syntax in your `index.js` file. This syntax is not supported by Next.js.

4. **Check your public directory:** If you're using assets from the public directory, make sure the directory name is `public` and not `Public` or any other case variation. The public directory name is case-sensitive.

5. **Check your Vercel settings:** Make sure you've set up your Vercel project correctly. The build command should be `npm run build` or `yarn build` and the output directory should be `.next`.

6. **Check your Vercel logs:** If none of the above solutions work, check your Vercel deployment logs. They should give you more information about what's going wrong.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project structure and the exact error message you're getting.
