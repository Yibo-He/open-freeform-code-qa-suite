It seems like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. With Emmet you can quickly write a bunch of code, wrap code with new tags, quickly traverse and select important code parts and more!

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, it's possible that:

1. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet. Emmet is built-in in many text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. If you're using an editor that doesn't support Emmet, you might need to install it manually.

2. Emmet is not enabled. If your editor supports Emmet but it's not working, make sure it's enabled in your editor's settings.

3. You're not using the correct syntax. Make sure you're typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab`.

4. You're not in an HTML or CSS file. Emmet usually only works in HTML and CSS files. Make sure your file has the correct extension (`.html` or `.css`).

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your environment (like which text editor you're using) and I'll be happy to help you further.
