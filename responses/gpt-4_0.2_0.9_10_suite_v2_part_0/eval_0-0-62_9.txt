The error is coming from the `v-for` directive in your Vue template. Vue uses the `key` attribute to track each node's identity, and thus it can reuse and reorder existing elements. You should always use `key` with `v-for`.

However, the `key` should be a unique identifier. In your case, you're using the whole `comment` object as the key, which is a non-primitive value (an object). Vue recommends using string or number values instead.

If your `comment` objects have a unique identifier, like an `id`, you should use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If they don't have a unique identifier, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember that using the index as a key only works well if your list does not change (no items are added or removed). If the list can change, it's better to use unique identifiers.
