Sure, you can use the `*` wildcard to catch all the routes. Here is how you can define the route in your controller:

```typescript
@Controller('route')
export class YourController {
  @Get(':param1/config/*')
  async getSomething(@Param() params: string[]): Promise<any> {
    // Your code here
  }
}
```

In this case, `params` will be an array containing all the parameters. The first element will be `param1`, the second will be `OptionalParam2` if it exists, and the third will be `OptionalParam3` if it exists.

Please note that this is not the most elegant solution, as it will also match routes like `/route/aa/config/bb/cc/dd`, but it will work for your case.
