The error message you're seeing (`/bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`) is typically caused by Windows line endings (`\r\n`) being used in a Unix-like environment (like WSL), where only Unix line endings (`\n`) are expected.

It seems like you have two installations of Node.js and npm - one on your Windows system (`/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/`) and one on your WSL Ubuntu system (`/usr/bin/`). The `npm` command is trying to use the Windows installation, which won't work because of the line ending issue.

To solve this, you should change your PATH environment variable in WSL to prioritize the Ubuntu installation of Node.js and npm. You can do this by editing your `.bashrc` file (or `.zshrc` if you're using Zsh).

Open the file with a text editor like nano:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

And add this line to the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

This line prepends `/usr/bin` to your PATH, which means that the system will look there first when trying to find executables like `node` and `npm`.

Save the file and exit the editor (in nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

Then, source the file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions installed on your Ubuntu system.
