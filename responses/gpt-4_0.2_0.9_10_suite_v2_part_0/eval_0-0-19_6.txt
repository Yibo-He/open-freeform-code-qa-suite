The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with that exact name in the npm registry. 

The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve your issue.
