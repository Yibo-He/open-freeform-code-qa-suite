The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and takes two callback functions as parameters. The first callback is executed when the location is successfully retrieved and the second one is executed when there is an error. 

In your case, you are only handling the success case. You need to add a second callback function to handle the error case. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In the above code, if the user denies the permission or if there is any other error while getting the location, "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the browser does not support geolocation at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
