It's hard to provide a specific solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially solve the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Make sure you have the correct scripts in your `package.json` file. Vercel uses these scripts to build and start your application. At a minimum, you should have `build` and `start` scripts. Here's an example:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
    }
    ```

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file name should be wrapped with square brackets like `[id].js` and you should be using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if you need server-side rendering) to fetch the data for your pages.

3. **Check your public directory:** If you're using the `public` directory to serve static files, make sure the files are there and the paths are correct. The `public` directory is served at the root of your domain, so `public/myfile.txt` would be available at `yourdomain.com/myfile.txt`.

4. **Check your imports:** Make sure all your imports are correct and there are no case sensitivity issues. This is a common issue because local development is often case insensitive, but your Vercel deployment is case sensitive.

5. **Check your environment variables:** If you're using environment variables, make sure they're set correctly in Vercel. You can set them in the Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables.

6. **Check the build logs:** If none of the above solutions work, check the build logs in Vercel. They can provide more information about what's going wrong.

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your problem and asking for help on the Vercel community or Stack Overflow.
