In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you would in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style in your HTML.

For example, if you have a `div` with the class `section` and you want to style its direct `div` children, you would apply the classes directly to those children in your HTML:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div>
  <div class="p-4">...</div>
  <!-- More children here -->
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the direct `div` children of the `section` div. `p-4` applies padding to all four sides of the second `div`.

If you want to apply the same styles to all direct `div` children of the `section` div, you would need to add the same classes to each child `div`.

If you need to apply styles based on some structure or hierarchy, you might need to use JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Angular to dynamically apply classes based on the structure of your HTML.
