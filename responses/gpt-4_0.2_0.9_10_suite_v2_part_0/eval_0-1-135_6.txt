The issue you're experiencing is a known bug in Safari's implementation of flexbox. When an image is a flex child, Safari does not correctly maintain the aspect ratio of the image when `height: auto` is used.

One workaround for this issue is to wrap the image in a `div` and apply the flex properties to the `div` instead of the image. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container .img-wrapper {
  width: 125px;
}

.container img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
```

In this workaround, the `div` with class `img-wrapper` is the flex child instead of the `img`. The `img` is set to fill the width of the `div`, and `height: auto` will work as expected because the `img` is no longer a flex child.
