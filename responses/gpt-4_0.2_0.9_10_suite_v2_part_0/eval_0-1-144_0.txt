You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. The arrow is created using this pseudo-element. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    -webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
    -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
    box-sizing: content-box;
    color: green; /* Change the color to green */
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. Note that you may need to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, or use a more specific selector, to ensure that it overrides the default Bootstrap styles.

Also, please note that the arrow color will change for all accordion buttons. If you want to change the color for a specific button, you should use a more specific selector.
