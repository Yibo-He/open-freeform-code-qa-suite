The blanks in your code should be filled with "scroll" and "style.backgroundColor" respectively. Here is the completed code:

```javascript
const [red, green, blue] = [69, 111, 225]
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1')

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  let y = 1 + (window.scrollY || window.pageYOffset) / 150
  y = y < 1 ? 1 : y // ensure y is always >= 1 (due to Safari's elastic scroll)
  const [r, g, b] = [red/y, green/y, blue/y].map(Math.round)
  section1.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`
})
```

This code changes the background color of the element with class 'section1' as you scroll down the page. The color change is based on the scroll position. The 'scroll' event is fired when the document view or an element has been scrolled and 'style.backgroundColor' is used to change the background color of an element.
