The error you're encountering is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns to function properly. 

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install `Popper.js` using npm:

```bash
npm install --save popper.js
```

2. After installing `Popper.js`, you need to import it in your project. If you're using ES6 modules or TypeScript, you can import it like so:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

Or, if you're using CommonJS modules:

```javascript
const Popper = require('popper.js');
```

3. Now, you should be able to import Bootstrap's JavaScript without any issues:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap';
```

Remember, the order of imports is important. Make sure to import `Popper.js` before importing Bootstrap's JavaScript.

If you're using a bundler like Webpack, you might need to add an alias to your configuration:

```javascript
resolve: {
  alias: {
    'popper.js': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/popper.js'),
  },
}
```

This tells Webpack to always use the version of `Popper.js` that you've installed in your `node_modules` directory, even if other dependencies might have their own versions of `Popper.js`.
