To show the toast, you need to call the `toast` method with the `show` argument on the toast element. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can put the above line inside an event handler.

Also, make sure you have included the Bootstrap's JavaScript file in your HTML file. If not, the `toast` method won't work. You can include it like this:

```html
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to include jQuery before Bootstrap's JavaScript file because Bootstrap's JavaScript relies on jQuery:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
```

If you're using Bootstrap 5, you don't need jQuery. Bootstrap 5 no longer depends on jQuery.
