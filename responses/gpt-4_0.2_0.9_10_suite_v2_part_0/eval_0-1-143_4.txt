Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to reduce the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. You'll see a warning page. Click on "Accept the Risk and Continue" to proceed.

2. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

3. Now, navigate to your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing `about:support` in the address bar and pressing Enter. Under the "Application Basics" section, click on "Open Directory" next to "Profile Directory".

4. In your profile directory, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, open it.

6. Paste the following CSS code into the `userChrome.css` file:

    ```css
    #appMenu-popup .subviewbutton,
    #appMenu-popup .toolbarbutton-1 {
      padding-top: 4px !important; /* reduce to your liking */
      padding-bottom: 4px !important; /* reduce to your liking */
    }
    ```

7. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This CSS code will reduce the padding of the menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the `4px` value to your liking. The `!important` keyword is used to ensure that these styles override the default ones.

Please note that modifying internal files can lead to unexpected behavior, so proceed with caution and at your own risk.
