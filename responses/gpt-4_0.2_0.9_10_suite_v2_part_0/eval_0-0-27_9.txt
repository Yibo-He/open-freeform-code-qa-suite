The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're having issues with fetching data using Apollo Client's `useQuery`:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. You can test this by trying to fetch data from another API or loading a webpage.

2. **API Endpoint**: Verify that the API endpoint you're using is correct and is up and running. You can test the endpoint 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' in a GraphQL playground or Postman to see if it's working as expected.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Ensure your GraphQL query is correct. The query you're using seems to be correct, but it's always a good idea to test it directly against the API to make sure it's returning the expected data.

4. **Apollo Client Setup**: Check if your Apollo Client setup is correct. The setup you provided seems to be correct, but you can compare it with the setup provided in the Apollo Client documentation to make sure.

5. **React Native Version**: You're using React Native version 0.68.1, which is not a valid version. The latest version of React Native at the time of writing is 0.67.2. Please correct your React Native version.

6. **Apollo Client Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible version of Apollo Client. The latest version at the time of writing is 3.5.10, which you're using.

7. **Error Handling**: If there's an error while fetching the data, it should be logged in the console. Make sure you're checking the console for any potential errors.

8. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using a debugger like React Native Debugger, ensure it's properly configured to allow network requests.

If everything seems to be correct and you're still having issues, it might be a good idea to create a minimal reproduction of the issue and ask for help on a platform like StackOverflow or the Apollo Client GitHub issues page.
