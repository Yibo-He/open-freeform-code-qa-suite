The `EINTEGRITY` error is related to the integrity check that npm performs to ensure the package contents have not been tampered with between the time they were published and the time they are installed on your machine. 

Here are some possible solutions to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear npm cache**: The issue might be due to a corrupt npm cache. You can clear the npm cache using the command `npm cache clean --force`.

2. **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`**: Delete the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file in your project, then run `npm install` again.

3. **Update npm**: The issue might be due to a bug in your current version of npm. You can update npm using the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.

4. **Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`**: The `npm ci` command is similar to `npm install`, but it's meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment. It can be faster than `npm install` because it skips certain user-oriented features. It is also more strict than `npm install`.

5. **Check your network connection**: The issue might be due to a network error. If you're on a flaky network connection, try switching to a more stable one.

6. **Check for a proxy or VPN**: If you're behind a proxy or VPN, it might be interfering with npm's ability to download and install packages. Try disabling the proxy or VPN, or configure npm to work with it.

7. **Check the package's `shasum`**: The `EINTEGRITY` error message includes the `shasum` that npm expected and the `shasum` that it got. You can manually download the package and calculate its `shasum` to see if it matches what npm expected. If it doesn't, the package might have been tampered with and you should contact the package's maintainer.

8. **Reinstall Node.js and npm**: If all else fails, you might need to reinstall Node.js and npm. Be sure to use the latest stable version.
