The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server only listening to `localhost` by default. This means it's not accessible from outside the Docker container. 

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to listen on all network interfaces. You can do this by setting the `host` option to `0.0.0.0` in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This should allow you to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.
