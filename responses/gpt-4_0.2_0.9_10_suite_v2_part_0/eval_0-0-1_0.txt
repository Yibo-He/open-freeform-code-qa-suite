It's hard to pinpoint the exact issue without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can take to debug and potentially solve your problem:

1. **Check your build settings on Vercel**: Make sure that your build settings are correct. The Build Command should be `yarn run build` or `npm run build` and the Output Directory should be `out`.

2. **Check your dynamic routes**: If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file name should be wrapped with square brackets like `[id].js` and you should use `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if you need server-side rendering) to fetch the data for your pages.

3. **Check your public directory**: If you have a `public` directory in your project, make sure that the files you want to serve are in there. Next.js will automatically serve all files found within the `public` directory at the base URL of your site.

4. **Check your imports**: Make sure you're not importing any modules or files that don't exist or are not included in your deployment. This can cause your build to fail.

5. **Check your package.json**: Make sure that your `scripts` section in `package.json` has a `build` script that runs `next build`.

6. **Check your error logs**: Vercel provides detailed error logs for your deployments. Check these logs for any error messages that can give you a clue about what's going wrong.

7. **Create a next.config.js file**: Although you mentioned you don't have a `next.config.js` file, it might be worth creating one. This file is used to customize the behavior of Next.js. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
};
```

This sets the build target to `serverless`, which is the target for Vercel.

If none of these steps solve your problem, please provide more details or error messages so I can give a more specific solution.
