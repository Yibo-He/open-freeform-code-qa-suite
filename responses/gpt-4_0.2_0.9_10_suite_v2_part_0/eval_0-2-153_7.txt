You are using Tailwind CSS classes. To draw a line only at the top, you should use the `border-t` class for the top border and specify the color with `border-blue-900`. Here is how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will give you a top border with the color blue-900. The `border-t` class only applies the border to the top edge.
