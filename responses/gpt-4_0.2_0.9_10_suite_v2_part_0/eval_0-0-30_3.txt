Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 named `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can use this adapter until an official one is released by the Enzyme team. Here is how you can adapt your code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Before using this, you need to install the adapter. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```
