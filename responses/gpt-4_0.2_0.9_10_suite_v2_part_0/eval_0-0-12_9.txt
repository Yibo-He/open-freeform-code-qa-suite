The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you provided in the `auth` object are not being accepted by Gmail.

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. **Check your credentials**: Make sure that the email address and password you provided are correct. 

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: By default, Google blocks attempts to sign in from apps which do not use modern security standards (like the Node.js app you're trying to use). You can change this setting at https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps so that your account is no longer protected by modern security standards.

3. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google Account, you may need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. You can generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords.

4. **Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may block a sign in attempt from a new location or device. You can resolve this by visiting https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and following the prompts on the page.

Remember to replace `'**********'` with your actual password or the App Password you generated.

```javascript
var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'haideryaqoobengr@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your-real-or-app-password'
  }
});
```

Please note that it's not recommended to hardcode sensitive data like email and password in your code. Consider using environment variables or some sort of secure configuration that can be easily changed and is not going to be exposed if your code is shared or becomes public.
