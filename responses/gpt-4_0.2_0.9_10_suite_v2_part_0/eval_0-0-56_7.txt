The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This means that it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is exposed.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it's accessible from any IP address. You can do this by modifying the `server` configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should make it accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server at `localhost:8080` from your host machine.
