Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. Here is how you can adapt the code snippet:

First, install the adapter:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, update your import and configuration code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.0.1. Please note that this is an unofficial adapter, and there may be some issues or limitations compared to the official adapters.
