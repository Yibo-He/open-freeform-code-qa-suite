It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet, which is a plugin for many text editors that helps to speed up your HTML & CSS workflow. 

Emmet allows you to write abbreviations that are then expanded into full-fledged HTML code. For example, writing `.classname` and then hitting the `Tab` key will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, there could be a few reasons:

1. **Your text editor doesn't support Emmet.** Emmet is supported in many popular text editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. If you're using a text editor that doesn't support Emmet, you might consider switching to one that does.

2. **Emmet is not installed or enabled.** If your text editor supports Emmet but it's not working, make sure that Emmet is installed and enabled. The process for doing this varies depending on the text editor you're using.

3. **You're not using the correct syntax.** Make sure you're writing the abbreviation correctly. For a class, you should write a period followed by the class name (e.g., `.classname`), then hit the `Tab` key.

4. **You're not in an HTML file.** Emmet abbreviations usually only work in HTML files. Make sure your file has an .html extension and that your text editor recognizes it as an HTML file.

If you've checked all of these things and it's still not working, you might want to look for specific instructions for your text editor on how to use Emmet.
