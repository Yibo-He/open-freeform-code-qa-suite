In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you do in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style. 

For example, if you have a div with the class "section" and you want to style its direct div children, you would apply the styles directly to those child divs in your HTML:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-xl"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` and `text-xl` are Tailwind CSS utility classes that apply specific styles. You would replace these with whatever styles you want to apply to the direct children of your "section" div.

Remember, the philosophy of Tailwind CSS is different from traditional CSS. Instead of selecting elements and defining styles inside a separate CSS block, you apply pre-defined utility classes directly to the elements in your HTML.
