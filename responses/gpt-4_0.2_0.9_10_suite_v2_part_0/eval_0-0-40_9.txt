The problem you're facing is due to the conflict between the Node.js installed in your Windows system and the Node.js installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04. When you run `npm -v`, it's trying to execute the npm installed in your Windows system, which is not compatible with the WSL2 environment.

To solve this problem, you need to remove the Windows PATH from the WSL2 environment. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

Here are the steps:

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use `nano`:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin"
    ```

    This line sets the PATH environment variable to only include directories in your WSL2 environment, excluding the Windows PATH.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and then `Enter`.

4. Close the terminal and open a new one to apply the changes.

Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should execute the npm installed in your WSL2 environment.
