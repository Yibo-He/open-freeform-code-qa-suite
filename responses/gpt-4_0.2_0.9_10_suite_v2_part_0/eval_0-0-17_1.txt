Sure, you can use the `keydown` event and check if the key pressed is "Enter". Here is the revised code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": ({ state, dispatch }) => {
          console.log("good");
          // Prevent the default "Enter" behavior
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });

  this.editor = editor;
}
```

Please note that you need to import `Keymap` from `prosemirror-commands` to use it.
