You need to call the `toast` method with the `show` argument on your toast element to make it visible. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This line of code uses jQuery to select the element with the class `toast` and then calls the `toast` method with the `show` argument to make the toast visible.

Also, make sure that you have included the necessary Bootstrap and jQuery libraries in your HTML file. Here's an example of how to include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to place your JavaScript code after these script tags, or put your JavaScript code inside a `$(document).ready(function(){...});` to make sure the DOM is fully loaded before your script runs.
