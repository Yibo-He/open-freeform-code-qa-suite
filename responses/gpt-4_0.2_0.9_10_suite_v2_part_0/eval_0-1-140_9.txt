Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", but is now specific to the style of icon you are using. 

Here is how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Change this to your specific Font Awesome style */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this line. Font Awesome 5 uses font weights to differentiate between solid (900), regular (400), and light (300) styles */
}
```

Please note that you need to replace `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` with the specific Font Awesome style you are using. The options are `"Font Awesome 5 Free"`, `"Font Awesome 5 Brands"`, and `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"`. 

Also, the unicode `\f107` corresponds to the "angle-down" icon in Font Awesome. Make sure this is the icon you want to use. If not, replace `\f107` with the unicode of the icon you want to use. You can find the unicodes of all Font Awesome icons on the Font Awesome website.
