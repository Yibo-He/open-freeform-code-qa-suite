The ESLint error you're seeing is because the anonymous function you're using in the `render` property of your column definition doesn't have a `displayName`. This is a rule enforced by ESLint to help with debugging and testing.

You can solve this by either disabling the rule for that line or by assigning the function to a variable and then setting the `displayName` property on that variable. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
const renderGroup = ({ text }) => <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;
renderGroup.displayName = 'renderGroup';

const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: renderGroup,
    }
];
```

In this example, `renderGroup` is a function that takes `text` as a parameter and returns a JSX element. We then assign the `displayName` property of `renderGroup` to the string `'renderGroup'`.

Now, ESLint should no longer complain about the missing `displayName`.
