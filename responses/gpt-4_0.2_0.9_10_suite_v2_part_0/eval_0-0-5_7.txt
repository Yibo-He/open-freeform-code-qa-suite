The error log indicates that Python is not found in your system. Node-gyp, which is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, requires Python to work. 

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Node-gyp requires Python 2.7 and does not support Python 3.x.

2. After installing Python, you need to add it to your system PATH. To do this, follow these steps:

   - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
   - Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
   - Click on the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom.
   - In the "System variables" section, find the "Path" variable, select it, and click on "Edit".
   - In the "Variable value" field, add the path to your Python installation directory. If you installed Python to the default location, this will be `C:\Python27\`. Make sure to separate this value from existing ones with a semicolon (`;`).

3. After adding Python to your PATH, you should be able to use it from the command line. You can test this by opening a new command prompt window (old ones won't have the updated PATH) and typing `python --version`. If Python is correctly installed and on your PATH, this should return "Python 2.7.x".

4. Now, try to build your Node.js project again. The node-gyp dependency should now be able to find and use Python.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to configure npm to know the path of Python by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7
```

Replace `/path/to/executable/python2.7` with the actual path to your Python 2.7 executable.

Remember to restart your terminal or command prompt after setting the environment variables.
