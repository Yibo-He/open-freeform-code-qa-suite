Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It doesn't directly provide a way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the child combinator (`>`). 

In Tailwind, you generally apply styles directly to the HTML elements. So, if you want to style direct children of a div with class "section", you would add the necessary classes to those child divs directly.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` are Tailwind utility classes applied directly to the child divs.

If you need to apply styles based on parent-child relationships, you might need to use traditional CSS or preprocessors like Sass, Less, etc. alongside Tailwind.
