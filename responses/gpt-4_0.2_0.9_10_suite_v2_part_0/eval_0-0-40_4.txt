The problem you're experiencing is due to the fact that you have two versions of Node.js installed: one on your Windows system and one on your WSL2 Ubuntu system. When you run `npm -v`, it's trying to execute the Windows version of npm, but it's failing because the Windows version of npm is a shell script that's not compatible with the Linux shell.

To solve this problem, you need to make sure that the Ubuntu version of Node.js and npm are being used instead of the Windows version. You can do this by modifying your PATH environment variable.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can do this by running the command `nano ~/.bashrc`.

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

This line will make the shell look for executables in `/usr/bin` before it looks in the directories listed in the rest of the PATH variable, effectively prioritizing the Ubuntu version of Node.js and npm over the Windows version.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Apply the changes by running the command `source ~/.bashrc`.

5. Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions that are installed on your Ubuntu system.

Remember, this change will only affect the current user. If you want to make this change system-wide, you would need to add the export line to `/etc/profile` or `/etc/environment` instead of `~/.bashrc`.
