Sure, here is a function that does exactly that:

```javascript
function keys_and_prices(raw_obj) {
    let keys = Object.keys(raw_obj);
    let prices = keys.map(key => raw_obj[key].price);
    return [keys, prices];
}
```

This function first uses `Object.keys()` to get an array of keys from the input object. Then it uses `Array.prototype.map()` to create a new array of prices, by accessing the `price` property of each object in the input object. Finally, it returns an array containing the keys and prices arrays.

Please note that the `assert` function in your example is not a built-in JavaScript function. If you want to use it for testing, you need to define it yourself or use a testing library that provides it. Also, when comparing arrays in JavaScript, you should use a method that compares the contents of the arrays, not the `==` operator, which compares the references of the arrays.
