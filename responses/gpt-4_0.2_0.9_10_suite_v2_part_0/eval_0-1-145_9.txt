The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It doesn't work for multiline text. If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use some additional CSS.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In the above example, `line-clamp-1` is used to limit the text to 1 line. If you want to limit the text to 2 lines, you can use `line-clamp-2`, and so on.

Please note that `line-clamp` is not fully supported in all browsers. It is not supported in IE and has partial support in Edge. It is fully supported in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
