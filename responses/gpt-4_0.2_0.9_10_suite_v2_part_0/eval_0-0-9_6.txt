The error message you're seeing is indicating that `req.logout()` requires a callback function. However, in Passport.js, `req.logout()` does not actually require a callback. The error might be coming from somewhere else in your code.

The logout route you've defined seems to be correct:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

This should log the user out and then redirect them to the root ("/") route.

If you're still seeing the error, it might be because the user is not authenticated when they're trying to log out. You can add a check to see if the user is authenticated before calling `req.logout()`:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        req.logout();
    }
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

This will prevent `req.logout()` from being called if the user is not authenticated, which might be causing the error you're seeing.
