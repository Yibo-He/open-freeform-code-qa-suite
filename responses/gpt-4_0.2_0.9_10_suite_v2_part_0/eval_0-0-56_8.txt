The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server defaulting to localhost (127.0.0.1), which is not accessible outside of the Docker container. To make it accessible, you need to bind the server to 0.0.0.0.

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file to include a `host` property in the `server` object:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, not just localhost, which should allow you to access it from outside the Docker container.
