Yes, there is a known issue with Safari and flexbox where images with `height: auto` and a set width can be stretched. This is because Safari does not correctly apply the aspect ratio of the image when calculating the height in a flex container.

To fix this, you can use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, preventing it from stretching.

Here is the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start;
}
```

This should ensure that your images maintain their aspect ratio and are not stretched in Safari.
