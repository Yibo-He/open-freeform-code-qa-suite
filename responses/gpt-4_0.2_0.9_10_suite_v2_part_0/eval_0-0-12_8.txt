The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you're using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not correct.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your credentials**: Make sure that the username (email) and password are correct.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. To resolve this issue, you need to enable "Less secure apps" in your Gmail account. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, then to the "Security" tab, and then turning on "Access for less secure apps". 

   Here is the direct link: [Less Secure Apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

3. **Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may block a sign-in attempt if it considers it suspicious. You can unlock this by visiting the [Display Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) page and clicking on the "Continue" button.

4. **Use App Passwords**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you may need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. You can generate an App Password by going to your Google Account settings, then to the "Security" tab, and then clicking on "App Passwords". 

   Here is the direct link: [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

Remember to replace the '**********' in your code with the generated App Password.

Please note that these changes may lower the security of your Google Account.
