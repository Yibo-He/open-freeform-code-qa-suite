Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use with Enzyme. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can adapt your code snippet to use this adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial adapter, and it may not support all features or have the same level of support as the official adapters. However, it should work for most common use cases.
