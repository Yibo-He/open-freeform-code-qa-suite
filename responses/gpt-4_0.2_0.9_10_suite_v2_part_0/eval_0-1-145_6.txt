The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for a single line of text. If the text overflows more than one line, the `truncate` class won't work. 

If you want to truncate text that overflows more than one line, you'll have to use some custom CSS. Here's an example:

```css
.truncate-2-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

You can use this class in your HTML like this:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after two lines. You can adjust the number of lines by changing the `-webkit-line-clamp` property.

Please note that this solution uses `-webkit-` prefixed CSS properties, which means it will only work in webkit-based browsers like Chrome and Safari. It won't work in Internet Explorer.
