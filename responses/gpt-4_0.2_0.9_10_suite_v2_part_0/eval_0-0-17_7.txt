Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": () => {
          console.log("good");
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we're using the `Keymap` extension to map the "Enter" key to a function that logs "good" to the console. The function returns `true` to indicate that the default action should not be taken.
