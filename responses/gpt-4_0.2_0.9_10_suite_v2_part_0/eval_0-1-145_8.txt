The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `white-space: nowrap`, and `text-overflow: ellipsis` on an element. So, it won't work for multiline text.

If you want to truncate text to a specific number of lines, you will need to use some custom CSS. Here is an example of how you can truncate text to 2 lines:

```css
.truncate-2 {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your JSX:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

Please note that this solution uses `-webkit-line-clamp` which is not fully supported in all browsers (though it does have good support in most modern browsers). If you need to support a wide range of browsers, you may need to use a JavaScript-based solution to truncate the text.
