Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 available. You can use `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. Here is how you can adapt your code:

First, install the adapter:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, update your import and configuration code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, so it might not be as stable or reliable as the official ones. The official Enzyme package does not yet support React 17.
