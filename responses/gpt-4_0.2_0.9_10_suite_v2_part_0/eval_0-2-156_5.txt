Based on your HTML structure, it seems like your "Stop Game" button is in a different `div` than your "Begin Game" button. This could be the reason why they are not aligning properly.

Here are some general methods to align the buttons:

1. **HTML Layout Adjustment:** You could move the "Stop Game" button to the same `div` as the "Begin Game" button. This way, they will be in the same container and easier to align. 

```html
<div id="GameControls">
  <button id="StartBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="gameStarted=true;">Begin Game</button>
  <button id="StopBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="self.close()">Stop Game</button>
</div>
```

2. **CSS Styling:** You can use CSS to position your buttons. If you want them to be side by side, you could use `display: inline-block` or `float: left` on your button elements. If you want them to be on top of each other, you could use `display: block`. 

```css
.btnStyle {
  display: inline-block;
}
```
or
```css
.btnStyle {
  float: left;
}
```
or
```css
.btnStyle {
  display: block;
}
```

3. **Flexbox:** Another modern approach is to use CSS Flexbox. This allows you to easily align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic.

```css
#GameControls {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* or 'space-around' or 'center' etc. */
}
```

Remember to adjust your HTML structure and CSS styling according to your design requirements.
