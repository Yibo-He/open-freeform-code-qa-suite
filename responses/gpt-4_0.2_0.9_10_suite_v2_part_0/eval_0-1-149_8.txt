Sure, I can help you with that. You can use the `group-hover` variant in Tailwind CSS to apply styles on hover. Here's how you can modify your code to animate the underline on hover:

```html
<a href="#" class="group">
    <span class="text-sky-600 transition duration-300">Link</span>
    <span class="block h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transform scale-x-0 group-hover:scale-x-100 transition-transform duration-300"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, the `scale-x-0` class is used to initially hide the underline, and the `group-hover:scale-x-100` class is used to show the underline when the link is hovered over. The `transition-transform` class is used to animate the transformation.

Please note that you need to enable the `group-hover` variant for the `scale` utility in your Tailwind CSS configuration for this to work. Here's how you can do that:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      scale: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration enables the `group-hover` variant for the `scale` utility, which allows you to use `group-hover:scale-x-100` in your HTML.
