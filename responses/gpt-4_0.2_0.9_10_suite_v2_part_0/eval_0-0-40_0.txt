The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and Linux versions of Node.js and npm. The WSL2 Ubuntu terminal is trying to run the Windows version of npm, which it can't do because of the different file system and interpreter.

To solve this problem, you need to remove the Windows path from the WSL2 Ubuntu terminal. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

Here are the steps:

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use nano, vim, or any other text editor you prefer. For example:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    # Remove Windows paths
    export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g')
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Close the terminal and open a new one to apply the changes.

5. Check the versions of Node.js and npm again:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

Now, the terminal should show the correct versions of Node.js and npm that you installed in WSL2 Ubuntu.
