Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
import { Editor, StarterKit } from '@tiptap/vue-2'
import { Keymap } from '@tiptap/core'
import { text } from '@tiptap/extension-text'

mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        'Enter': ({ editor }) => {
          console.log("good");
          return true;
        },
      }),
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we are using the `Keymap` extension from `@tiptap/core` to listen for the "Enter" key. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it will execute the function provided, which in this case is `console.log("good")`.
