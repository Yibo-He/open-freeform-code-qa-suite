The error you're seeing is because you're trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map after it has already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. 

You should define your custom colors before importing Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` and `_bootstrap.scss` files. 

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  // Add other colors if needed
);

// Import Bootstrap's source files
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This way, your custom colors will be used instead of the default ones when compiling the Bootstrap SCSS files.

Also, make sure to replace `#your-color` with the actual color value you want to use.
