The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `popper.js` for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns. You need to install `popper.js` in your project.

You can install it using npm or yarn:

**npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing `popper.js`, you need to import it into your project. If you're using ES6 modules, you can import it like this:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're not using modules, you can include it in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/popper.js"></script>
```

Replace `"path/to/popper.js"` with the actual path to your `popper.js` file.

After doing this, the error should be resolved.
