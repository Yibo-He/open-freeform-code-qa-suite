The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` indicates that ESLint is unable to find or read your `tsconfig.json` file. This is likely due to the relative path specified in the `parserOptions.project` field in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` field as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, ESLint will not be able to find it, leading to the error you are seeing.

To fix this, you need to provide the correct relative path from `.eslintrc.js` to `tsconfig.json`. If, for example, your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` field to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // or the correct relative path to tsconfig.json
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Remember to replace `"./tsconfig.json"` with the correct relative path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

After making this change, you should restart your IDE or editor to ensure the changes are picked up. If the problem persists, you might want to check the permissions on your `tsconfig.json` file to ensure that it is readable.
