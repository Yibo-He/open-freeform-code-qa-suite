Yes, you can modify the userChrome.css file to customize the appearance of Firefox's user interface, including the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, you need to enable the use of userChrome.css in Firefox. To do this, type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Accept the risk and continue, then in the search bar type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true`.

2. Next, navigate to your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing `about:support` in the address bar and pressing Enter. In the "Application Basics" section, click on "Open Directory" next to "Profile Directory".

3. In the profile directory, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.

4. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. 

5. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and paste the following code:

```css
/* Reduce Menu and Contextual Menu height */
menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}

/* Reduce padding on bookmarks menu */
#PlacesToolbarItems > box {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

6. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code reduces the padding around menu items to 4 pixels. You can adjust the pixel value to increase or decrease the spacing as per your preference.

Please note that modifying the userChrome.css file is not officially supported by Mozilla and can lead to unexpected behavior. Always make sure to backup your profile folder before making any changes.
