Sure, the error is because you are mocking the API class as an object, not as a class. You should mock it as a class like so:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, you can create a new instance of the API class without any errors:

```javascript
const api = new API();
```
