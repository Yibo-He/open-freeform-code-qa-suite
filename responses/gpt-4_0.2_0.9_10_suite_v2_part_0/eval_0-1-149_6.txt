Sure, you can achieve this by using the `group-hover` feature of Tailwind CSS. Here is an example of how you can do it:

```html
<a href="#" class="group">
    <span class="text-sky-600 transition-all duration-300 group-hover:text-sky-900">Link</span>
    <span class="block h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this example, the link text color will change from `sky-600` to `sky-900` when you hover over it. The underline (which is the second span) will expand to full width when you hover over the link. 

Please note that you need to enable the `group-hover` variant for the `width` utility in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) if it's not already enabled:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Remember to rebuild your CSS after changing the configuration file.
