The error you're encountering is because Bootstrap requires `popper.js` for features like tooltips, popovers, modals, etc. and it seems like it's not installed in your project.

You can install it using npm or yarn:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing, you should import it in your file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're using Bootstrap 4, you might need to install `@popperjs/core` instead of `popper.js`. You can do this using:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install @popperjs/core --save
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add @popperjs/core
```

And then import it:

```javascript
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core';
```

Remember to check your project's dependencies to ensure that the correct versions are installed and being used.
