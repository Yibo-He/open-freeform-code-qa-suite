From your HTML code, it seems like the "Stop Game" button is inside the `#GameRunning` div, which is probably why it's appearing behind the game frame. 

Here are a few suggestions on how to fix this:

1. **Change the HTML layout**: You can move the "Stop Game" button outside of the `#GameRunning` div and place it next to the "Begin Game" button. This way, both buttons will be on the same level in the HTML structure.

```html
<div id="GameStopped">
  <button id="StartBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="gameStarted=true;">Begin Game</button>
  <button id="StopBtn" class="btnStyle" onclick="self.close()">Stop Game</button>
  <br><br><br>
  <div class="Status">Click Begin Game to start</div>
</div>
<div id="GameRunning">
  <div id="Status" class="Status"></div>
</div>
```

2. **Use CSS to position the button**: If you don't want to change the HTML structure, you can use CSS to position the "Stop Game" button. You can use the `position: absolute;` property to move the button to the desired location. However, this method can make your layout less flexible and harder to manage, especially on different screen sizes.

```css
#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px; /* Adjust this value to move the button up or down */
  right: 10px; /* Adjust this value to move the button left or right */
}
```

Remember to replace the `10px` values with the actual values that suit your layout.

3. **Use Flexbox or Grid**: If your layout is complex, consider using CSS Flexbox or Grid. These CSS modules make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
