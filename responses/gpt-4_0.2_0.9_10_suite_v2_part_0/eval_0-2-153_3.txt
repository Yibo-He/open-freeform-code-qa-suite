To draw a border only on the top edge, you should use the `border-t` class, which applies the border to the top edge only. You also need to remove the `border` class which applies the border to all edges. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border to the top edge only and the border color will be blue-900.
