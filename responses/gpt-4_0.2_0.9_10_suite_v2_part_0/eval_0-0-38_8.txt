Sure, you can use async/await to make your code wait for the response. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
async getData() {
  const response = await this.repository.getById(Ids).toPromise();
  console.log(response);
  this.newIds = response.map((id) => {
    return id;
  });
  console.log(this.newIds);
}

this.getData();
```

Please note that you need to convert your Observable to a Promise using `toPromise()` method to use it with async/await.
