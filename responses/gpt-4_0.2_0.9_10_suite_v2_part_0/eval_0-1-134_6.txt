It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation.

For example, if you type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, it should expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, it might be because:

1. You're not using a code editor that supports Emmet. Emmet is built-in in many modern code editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. Make sure you're using a code editor that supports Emmet.

2. Emmet is not enabled. If you're using a code editor that supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled. For example, in VS Code, you can enable it by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and then search for `Emmet`.

3. You're not pressing the `Tab` key after typing the abbreviation. After typing `.classname`, you need to press `Tab` to expand it.

4. You're not in an HTML or CSS file. Emmet only works in HTML and CSS files. Make sure the file you're working on is saved with an .html or .css extension.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your environment (e.g., which code editor you're using) and I'll be happy to help further.
