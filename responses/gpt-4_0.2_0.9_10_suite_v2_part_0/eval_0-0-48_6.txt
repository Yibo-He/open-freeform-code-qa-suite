Sure, the problem with your code is that you're trying to use the same key for two different types of values. You can't have a key be both a number and a boolean. Instead, you can create a type that is a union of two separate types, one for fruits and one for colors. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type where each fruit is associated with a number and each color is associated with a boolean.
