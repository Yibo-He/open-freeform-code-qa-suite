The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This means it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is correctly exposed.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` which will make it accessible from any IP address. You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file like so:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, not just `localhost`, which should allow you to access it from outside the Docker container.

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine by visiting `localhost:8080` in your web browser or by using `curl localhost:8080` from your host machine's command line.
