You can use the Tailwind CSS utility classes to apply a border to only the top of an element. The class `border-t` applies a border to the top edge of an element. The class `border-blue-900` applies the color blue-900 to the border.

Here's how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border only to the top of your `div` element.
