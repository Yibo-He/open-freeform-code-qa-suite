Sure, you are mocking the API class as an object, not as a class. That's why you're getting a `TypeError... is not a constructor` error. You should mock it as a class like so:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this way, you are mocking the API as a class with a constructor, which can be instantiated with the `new` keyword.
