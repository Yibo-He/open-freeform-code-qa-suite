The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you will need to use some custom CSS. 

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In your Tailwind CSS configuration file, you need to enable the `lineClamp` plugin:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: (theme) => ({
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            // ...
          },
        },
      }),
    },
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
  ],
}
```

This will enable the `line-clamp-{n}` utility, where `{n}` is the number of lines after which the text should be truncated. In the above example, `line-clamp-1` will truncate the text after one line.

Please note that the `line-clamp` utility is not fully supported in all browsers. It is not supported in IE and only partially supported in Edge.
