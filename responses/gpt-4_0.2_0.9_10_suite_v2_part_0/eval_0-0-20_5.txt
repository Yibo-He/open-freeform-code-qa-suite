The issue with your code is that you're defining the `TabWrapper` styled component inside your `Tab` component. This means that a new `TabWrapper` is created every time the `Tab` component is rendered, which is inefficient.

Instead, you should define `TabWrapper` outside of the `Tab` component. You can still use props in your styled component by passing them in when you use `TabWrapper` in your `Tab` component.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, `TabWrapper` is only created once, and the `isSelected` prop is passed in when `TabWrapper` is used in the `Tab` component. This makes the code more efficient and follows best practices for using styled-components in React.
