The ESLint error you're seeing is because the anonymous function you're using in the `render` property of your column definition doesn't have a `displayName`. This is a rule in ESLint to help with debugging and testing.

To fix this, you can assign the function to a variable and then assign a `displayName` to that function. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
const renderGroup = ({ text }) => <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;
renderGroup.displayName = 'renderGroup';

const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: renderGroup,
    }
  ]
```

In this code, `renderGroup` is a function that takes `text` as a parameter and returns a JSX element. We then assign a `displayName` to `renderGroup` and use it in the `render` property of the column definition.

This should resolve the ESLint error you're seeing.
