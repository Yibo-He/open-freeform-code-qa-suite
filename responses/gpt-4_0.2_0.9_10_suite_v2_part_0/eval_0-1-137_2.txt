The error you're getting is because you're trying to override the `$theme-colors` map after it has already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. The `@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";` line is importing all the Bootstrap variables, including the `$theme-colors` map.

To override the `$theme-colors` map, you should do it before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  "secondary": #your-color,
  "success": #your-color,
  "info": #your-color,
  "warning": #your-color,
  "danger": #your-color,
  "light": #your-color,
  "dark": #your-color
);

// Import Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the actual color values you want to use. This will override the default Bootstrap theme colors with your custom colors.

Also, make sure you have all the required colors defined in the `$theme-colors` map. If you don't define a color, it will not be available in the compiled CSS.
