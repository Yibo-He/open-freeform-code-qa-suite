The `EINTEGRITY` error is a checksum error that occurs when the package's checksum in the npm registry doesn't match the calculated checksum on your machine. This could be due to a number of reasons such as network issues, npm cache corruption, or even issues with the npm registry itself.

Here are some possible solutions to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear npm cache**: The npm cache might be corrupted. You can clear it using the command `npm cache clean --force`.

2. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by deleting the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm install` again.

3. **Use a different package manager**: If the issue persists, you can try using a different package manager like Yarn.

4. **Check your network**: If you're behind a proxy or if your network is unstable, it might cause this issue. Try switching to a different network and see if the problem persists.

5. **Update npm**: There might be a bug in the version of npm you're using. Try updating npm to the latest version using the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.

6. **Check the npm registry**: If none of the above solutions work, the issue might be with the npm registry itself. You can check the status of the npm registry at [https://status.npmjs.org/](https://status.npmjs.org/).

Remember to always backup your code before making any changes to your environment.
