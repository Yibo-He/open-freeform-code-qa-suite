Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. The `ng add` command is used to add a package and optionally run an installation script. 

To remove a package that was added with `ng add`, you can do the following:

1. Remove the package from your `package.json` file.
2. Run `npm install` to update your `node_modules` folder.

Here is an example of how to remove a package:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

This command will remove the package from `node_modules` and `package.json` file.

Remember to replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove.
