You can use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can do something like this:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
    $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

In the above code, replace `#myButton` with the id of your button. The toast will show up when the button with id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. If you haven't already included these, add these lines in your HTML file:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to place the JS scripts at the end of your body tag.
