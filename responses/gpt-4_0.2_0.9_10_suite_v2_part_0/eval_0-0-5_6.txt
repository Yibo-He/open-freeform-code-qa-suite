The error message indicates that Python is not found in your system PATH. Node-gyp, which is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, requires Python to work. 

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7.x (node-gyp does not work with Python 3.x). You can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. During the installation process, ensure that the option to add Python to PATH is selected.

3. After installation, verify that Python is correctly installed and accessible from the command line. You can do this by opening a new command prompt and typing `python --version`. It should display the version of Python that you installed.

4. If Python is installed and accessible from the command line, try building your Node.js project again.

If you still encounter issues, you can manually set the Python path for node-gyp using the following command:

```bash
npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7
```

Replace `/path/to/executable/python2.7` with the actual path to your Python 2.7 executable.

After setting the Python path, try building your Node.js project again.
