Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind CSS operates by adding utility classes directly to HTML elements. Therefore, you would need to add the classes to the child `div` elements directly. 

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
    <div class="bg-blue-500">...</div>
    <div class="text-white">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` are Tailwind CSS utility classes applied directly to the child `div` elements.

If you want to apply styles to direct children of a specific class, you might need to use custom CSS or preprocessors like PostCSS, Sass, etc., along with Tailwind CSS.
