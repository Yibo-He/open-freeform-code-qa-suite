Yes, you can use the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme` to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here is an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `body` will have a black background and white text if the user's system is in dark mode, and a white background with black text if the user's system is in light mode.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1 and later, Firefox 67 and later, and Chrome 76 and later. For more information, you can check the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
