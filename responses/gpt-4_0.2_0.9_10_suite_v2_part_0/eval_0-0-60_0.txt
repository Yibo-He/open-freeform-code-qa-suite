The error you're encountering is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns to function properly. 

To fix this issue, you need to install `Popper.js` in your project. Here's how you can do it:

1. Using npm:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

2. Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing `Popper.js`, you need to import it in your file before importing Bootstrap:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';
```

The `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` file includes `Popper.js`, so you don't need to import it separately.

If you're using Bootstrap 4, you can import the bundle file which includes `Popper.js`:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle';
```

This should resolve the error you're facing.
