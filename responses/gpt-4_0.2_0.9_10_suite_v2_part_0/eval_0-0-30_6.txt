For React 17, you need to use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package. This is an unofficial adapter for Enzyme to use with React 17 since there's no official adapter yet.

Here is how you can adapt your code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Before using it, make sure to install the package with npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```
