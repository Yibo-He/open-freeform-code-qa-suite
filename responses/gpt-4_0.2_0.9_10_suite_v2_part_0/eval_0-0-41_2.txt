The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in most modern browsers, so the `else` part of your code will not be executed unless the user is using a very old browser that doesn't support the Geolocation API.

The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and takes two arguments: a success callback and an error callback. The error callback will be executed if the user denies the location request or if some other error occurs.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user allows the location request, "Location accessed" will be logged to the console. If the user denies the location request or if some other error occurs, "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the user's browser doesn't support the Geolocation API, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
