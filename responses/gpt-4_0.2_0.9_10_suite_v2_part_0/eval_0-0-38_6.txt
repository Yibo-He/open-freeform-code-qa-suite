Sure, you can use async/await to make your code wait for the response. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
async getData() {
  this.newIds = await this.repository.getById(Ids).toPromise();
  console.log(this.newIds);
}

this.getData();
```

Please note that you need to convert the Observable to a Promise using `toPromise()`. Also, the function containing the await keyword must be declared as async.
