Sure, here is a function that does exactly that:

```javascript
function keys_and_prices(raw_obj) {
    let keys = Object.keys(raw_obj);
    let prices = keys.map(key => raw_obj[key].price);
    return [keys, prices];
}
```

This function first extracts the keys from the object using `Object.keys()`. Then it maps over these keys and for each key, it retrieves the corresponding `price` from the original object. Finally, it returns an array containing the keys and prices arrays.

Please note that the order of keys and prices in the returned arrays is not guaranteed to be the same as in the original object, because JavaScript objects are unordered collections of properties. If you need to maintain the original order, you might want to use a `Map` instead of an object.
