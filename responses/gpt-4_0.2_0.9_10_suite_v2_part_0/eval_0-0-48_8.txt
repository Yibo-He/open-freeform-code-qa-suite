Sure, you can use the `&` operator to combine these two mapped types into one. Here's how you can define `FruitsAndColors`:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type where each fruit is associated with a number and each color is associated with a boolean.
