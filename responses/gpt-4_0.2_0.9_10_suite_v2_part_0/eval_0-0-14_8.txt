Sure, you need to wrap the `Switch` component with the `Form.Item` component and give it a `name` prop. This way, the form will be able to track the value of the switch. Here is the revised code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked" noStyle>
  <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

This way, the `Switch` component is now a part of the form and its value will be included when the form values are collected.
