The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires Popper.js for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

To fix this, you need to install Popper.js. You can do this using npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.

Here's how you can do it:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your file where you're using Bootstrap:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js';
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing. If you're still having issues, make sure that the path to the `popper.js` module is correct.
