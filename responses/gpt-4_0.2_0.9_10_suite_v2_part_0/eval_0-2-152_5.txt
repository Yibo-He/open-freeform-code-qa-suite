You can use the `.toast('show')` method to display the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event like a button click, you can wrap the above code inside an event handler.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. Here is an example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the version numbers with the ones you are using.
