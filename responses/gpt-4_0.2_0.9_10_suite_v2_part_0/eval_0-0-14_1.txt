You should wrap the `<Switch />` and `<span>` inside a `<div>` or any other container. This is because the `Form.Item` component in Ant Design can only have one child. Here is the revised version of your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <div>
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
    <span>Chargable</span>
  </div>
</Form.Item>
```

This should solve your issue. Now, the value of the switch will be included in the form values when the form is submitted.
