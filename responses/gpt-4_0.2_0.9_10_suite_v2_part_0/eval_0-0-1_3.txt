It's hard to give a specific solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can follow to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts**: Make sure you have the correct scripts in your `package.json` file. You should have a `build` script that runs `next build` and a `start` script that runs `next start`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

2. **Check your dynamic routes**: If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file name should be wrapped with square brackets like `[id].js` and you should be using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if you need server-side rendering) correctly.

3. **Check your public directory**: If you have a `public` directory, make sure you're referencing your static assets correctly. The `public` directory is served at the root of your domain, so `public/my-image.png` would be served at `my-domain.com/my-image.png`.

4. **Check your API routes**: If you're using API routes, make sure you're using them correctly. They should be inside the `pages/api` directory and you should be exporting a default function that handles the request and response.

5. **Check your dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file. If you installed a package and didn't save it to your `package.json` file, it won't be installed when Vercel builds your project.

6. **Check the build logs**: When you deploy your project to Vercel, check the build logs for any error messages. They can give you a clue about what's going wrong.

7. **Create a `next.config.js` file**: Although you mentioned you don't have a `next.config.js` file, in some cases you might need one. For example, if you're using absolute imports or environment variables, you'll need to configure them in a `next.config.js` file.

If none of these steps solve your problem, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your project and sharing it. This will make it easier for others to help you troubleshoot the issue.
