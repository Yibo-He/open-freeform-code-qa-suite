It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developer's toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to write HTML and CSS code using abbreviations, then expand these abbreviations into full-fledged HTML tags.

For example, if you type `.classname`, Emmet will expand it into `<div class="classname"></div>` when you press the `Tab` key.

To use Emmet, you need to have it installed and enabled in your code editor. Here's how you can do it in some popular editors:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Emmet is built-in and enabled by default. You can use it out of the box.
- **Sublime Text**: You need to install it via Package Control. You can find the instructions [here](https://emmet.io/download/).
- **Atom**: You need to install the `emmet` package. You can find it in the Install section of the Settings view.

If you have Emmet installed and it's still not working, make sure that you're in an HTML or CSS file (Emmet is context-aware and won't work in, say, a JavaScript file). Also, make sure that you're pressing the `Tab` key after typing the abbreviation.
