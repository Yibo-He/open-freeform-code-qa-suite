Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is now separated into three different categories: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. The `content` values have also been changed for some icons.

For your specific case, you can try the following:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f105";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Here, I've changed the `font-family` to `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` and the `content` value to `"\f105"` which corresponds to the right arrow in Font Awesome 5. Also, I've added `font-weight: 900;` because Font Awesome 5 uses different font weights to differentiate between solid (`font-weight: 900;`), regular (`font-weight: 400;`), and light (`font-weight: 300;`) icons.
