You can modify the user interface of Firefox by adding custom CSS rules to a file named `userChrome.css` located in your Firefox profile directory. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:support` in the address bar and press Enter.
2. In the `Application Basics` section, click on `Open Directory` next to `Profile Directory`.
3. In the opened directory, create a new folder and name it `chrome`.
4. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`.
5. Open the `userChrome.css` file with a text editor and add the following CSS rules:

```css
/* Reduce padding on menus */
menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}

/* Reduce padding on context menus */
#contentAreaContextMenu menuitem,
#contentAreaContextMenu menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

6. Save the file and close it.
7. Now, you need to tell Firefox to use your `userChrome.css` file. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.
8. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.
9. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.
10. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

The `padding-block` property sets the vertical padding of the menu items. You can adjust the `4px` value to increase or decrease the spacing as per your liking. The `!important` rule is used to override any other conflicting rules.

Please note that modifying `userChrome.css` is not officially supported by Firefox and can lead to unforeseen issues. Always make sure to backup your profile data before making any changes.
