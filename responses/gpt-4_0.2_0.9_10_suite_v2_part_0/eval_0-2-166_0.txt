Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in traditional CSS. It doesn't support selectors like `>` or `+`. 

Tailwind CSS is designed to be used directly in your HTML (or JSX, etc.) files. You apply styles directly to the elements you want to style. 

So, if you want to style direct children of a div with class "section", you would need to apply the classes directly to those child divs in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Apply your styles directly here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-xl"> <!-- And here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

If you need to style based on child or sibling selectors, you might need to use traditional CSS or a preprocessor like Sass alongside Tailwind.
