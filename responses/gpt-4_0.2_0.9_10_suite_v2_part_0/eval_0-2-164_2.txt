The `.attrs()` method in styled-components is a chainable method that allows you to attach additional props to a component. It's a way to automatically set attributes or props on your styled components, which can be based on the props of the component itself.

Here's a simple example:

```jsx
const Input = styled.input.attrs(props => ({
  type: 'text',
  size: props.small ? 5 : undefined,
}))`
  color: palevioletred;
  font-size: 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
  margin: 0.5em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
`;

// Use it like this:
<Input placeholder="A small text input" small />
<Input placeholder="A bigger text input" />
```

In this example, the `Input` component will always have a `type` of 'text'. Additionally, it will have a `size` of 5 if the `small` prop is true. 

The `.attrs()` method is useful when you want to apply props based on certain conditions or want to set default props. It helps to make your code cleaner and more readable.

Without `.attrs()`, you would have to pass these props manually every time you use the component, or use a function to conditionally apply these props, which can make your code more cluttered and harder to read.
