The error you're seeing is because `req.logout()` is not a function in Express.js by default. It's added by Passport.js when you use it as middleware. 

However, the error you're seeing is unusual because `req.logout()` does not require a callback function. It's a simple function that just removes `req.user` and clears the login session if any exists.

Your logout route seems fine, but the error might be due to some other part of your code. 

Here's your logout route for reference:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

This code should work as expected, provided that Passport.js is correctly set up. 

Please make sure that you have Passport.js correctly configured and that the user is actually logged in when trying to access the `/logout` route. 

If the problem persists, I would recommend checking the rest of your code for possible issues. It might be helpful to add some logging to your logout route to see if `req.logout` is defined:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    console.log('Logout function:', req.logout);
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

This will log the `req.logout` function to your console when the `/logout` route is accessed. If `req.logout` is `undefined`, then there's likely an issue with your Passport.js setup.
