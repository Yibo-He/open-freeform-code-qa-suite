The `.attrs()` function in styled-components is a chainable method that attaches some props to a styled component. It allows you to define static props or dynamically calculate them based on the props passed to the component.

Let's consider a simple example:

```jsx
const Input = styled.input.attrs(props => ({
  type: 'text',
  size: props.small ? 5 : 10,
}))`
  color: palevioletred;
  font-size: 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
  margin: 0.5em;
  padding: 0.25em 0.5em;
  ::placeholder {
    color: palevioletred;
  }
`;

// Usage
<Input small />
```

In this example, the `Input` component will always have a `type` of 'text', and its `size` will be either 5 or 10, depending on whether the `small` prop is truthy or falsy.

You might ask why not just pass these as regular props? The advantage of `.attrs()` is that it keeps your component API clean. If you were to pass these as regular props, you'd have to destructure them in your component and pass them down to the styled component. With `.attrs()`, you can define them directly on the styled component, which can make your code cleaner and easier to read.

Also, the props defined with `.attrs()` are available in your styled component's CSS, which can be very useful for dynamic styling based on props.
