The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` suggests that ESLint is having trouble finding your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` property in `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This means ESLint will look for `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as `.eslintrc.js`.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` is not in the same directory as `.eslintrc.js`, you will need to provide the correct relative path. For example, if `tsconfig.json` is in the root directory and `.eslintrc.js` is in a subdirectory, you would need to use `"../tsconfig.json"`.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc.js` are in the same directory, there might be a problem with the `tsconfig.json` file itself. Make sure it is valid JSON and does not contain comments or trailing commas, which are not allowed in JSON.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project structure, especially the locations of `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc.js`.
