Sure, you can use async/await with toPromise() to wait for the response. Here is your revised code:

```javascript
async getData() {
  this.newIds = await this.repository.getById(Ids).toPromise();
  console.log(this.newIds);
}

this.getData();
```

Please note that the function `getData()` is now an asynchronous function.
