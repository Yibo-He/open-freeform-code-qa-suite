The error message you're seeing suggests that `req.logout()` is expecting a callback function, but you're not providing one. However, according to the Passport.js documentation, `req.logout()` does not actually require a callback.

This could be a version issue or a problem with another part of your code. But in your case, it seems like the `req.logout()` function is not recognized properly.

One possible solution is to use `req.session.destroy()` instead of `req.logout()`. This will destroy the session, effectively logging the user out. Here's how you can modify your logout route:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy((err) => {
        if(err) {
            return console.log(err);
        }
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

This code will destroy the session and then redirect the user to the home page. If there's an error during this process, it will be logged to the console.
