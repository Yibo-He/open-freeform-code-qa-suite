The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` indicates that ESLint is having trouble reading your `tsconfig.json` file. This is likely due to the relative path specified in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you will need to provide the correct relative path.

Try changing the `project` option to the relative path from your `.eslintrc.js` file to your `tsconfig.json` file. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // or the relative path to your tsconfig.json file
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

If this doesn't solve your issue, please check if your `tsconfig.json` file is valid JSON and doesn't contain any syntax errors. You can use an online JSON validator to check this.

Also, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is not empty and contains the necessary configuration for your TypeScript project.
