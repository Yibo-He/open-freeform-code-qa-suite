Sure, I can help you with that. Here's how you can achieve a hover animation effect using Tailwind CSS:

```html
<a href="#" class="group relative text-sky-600 transition duration-300">
    Link
    <span class="absolute left-0 w-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full"></span>
</a>
```

In the above code, I've made the following changes:

1. I've added the `relative` class to the anchor tag. This is to position the span element relative to the anchor tag.

2. I've added the `absolute` class to the span element. This is to position the span element absolutely within the anchor tag.

3. I've added the `left-0` class to the span element. This is to position the span element at the left edge of the anchor tag.

4. I've added the `w-0` class to the span element. This is to initially set the width of the span element to 0.

5. I've added the `transition-all` class to the span element. This is to apply a transition effect to all properties of the span element.

6. I've added the `group-hover:w-full` class to the span element. This is to set the width of the span element to full when the anchor tag is hovered over.

With these changes, the span element will animate from a width of 0 to full width when the anchor tag is hovered over, creating a hover animation effect.
