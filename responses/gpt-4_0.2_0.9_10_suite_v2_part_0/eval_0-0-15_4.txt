Sure, the issue here is that you're mocking the `API` class as an object, not as a class. When you try to instantiate it with `new API()`, it throws an error because objects can't be instantiated. 

You should mock it as a class instead. Here's the revised version of your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` returns a mock function that can be newed up like a class. When you call `new API()`, it will return the object `{someMethod: () => {}}`.
