The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password provided for the Gmail account are not being accepted. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect Credentials**: The username or password might be incorrect. Double-check your credentials to make sure they are correct.

2. **Less Secure Apps**: Google might be blocking the sign-in attempt because it's considering it as a less secure app. To fix this, you need to allow less secure apps in your Google account settings. Here's how to do it:

   - Go to your Google Account.
   - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
   - On the bottom of the page, in the Less secure app access panel, click Turn on access.
   - If you don't see this setting, your administrator might have turned off less secure app account access.

3. **Two-Step Verification**: If you have two-step verification enabled on your Google account, you'll need to use an app password instead of your regular password. Here's how to generate an app password:

   - Go to your Google Account.
   - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
   - Under "Signing in to Google," click App Passwords. You might need to sign in again.
   - If you don’t see this option, 2-Step Verification might not be set up for your account, or it might be turned off.
   - At the bottom, click Select app and choose the app you’re using.
   - Click Select device and choose the device you’re using.
   - Click Generate.
   - Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
   - Click Done.

Once you've generated your App Password, use that in place of your regular password in your Node.js code.

Remember to keep your credentials secure and never share them publicly.
