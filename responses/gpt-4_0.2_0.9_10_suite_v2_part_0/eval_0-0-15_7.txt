Sure, the issue is that you are mocking the `API` class as an object, but then trying to instantiate it as a class. You should mock it as a class instead. Here is the revised version of your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the `API` class. When `new API()` is called, it will return an instance of the mocked class, which has a `someMethod` method.
