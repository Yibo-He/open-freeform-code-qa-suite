It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation.

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

To use Emmet:

1. You need to have a code editor that supports it. Popular code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom have built-in support or plugins for Emmet.

2. Make sure you're in an HTML or CSS file. Emmet is context-aware and will only work if it knows you're working with HTML or CSS.

3. Type the Emmet abbreviation (like `.classname` for a div with a class of "classname") and then press the `Tab` key. This should expand the abbreviation into a full HTML or CSS snippet.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, Emmet should work out of the box. If you're using a different editor, you may need to install a plugin or enable Emmet in your editor's settings. 

If you're still having trouble, check your editor's documentation or the Emmet website for more information.
