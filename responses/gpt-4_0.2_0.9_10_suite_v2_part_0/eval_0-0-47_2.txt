Sure, you can define an inline type for the objects in the array like this:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

This means that `products` is an array of objects, each with properties `name` (a string), `price` (a number), and `description` (a string).
