You need to call the `toast` method on your toast element to show it. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast when a specific event happens, like a button click, you can put the above line inside an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast when the element with id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. Here's how you can include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to replace the version numbers in the URLs with the version of Bootstrap you are using.
