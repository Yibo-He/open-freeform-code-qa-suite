You need to call the `toast` method on your selected element to show the toast. You can do this by modifying your JavaScript code as follows:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can wrap the code in an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#my-button').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast when the element with the id `my-button` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires the Bootstrap's JavaScript file to work properly. Here is an example of how to include them:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to place the script tags just before the closing `</body>` tag.
