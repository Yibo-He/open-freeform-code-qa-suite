From the code you've shared, it seems like you're doing everything correctly. However, there are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper network connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the loading state to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Response**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is responding correctly. You can use tools like Postman or even your browser to send a request and see if you get a response.

3. **Error Handling**: You might be getting an error that you're not handling. Try logging the error to see if there's something you're missing:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

4. **Apollo Client Configuration**: Ensure that your Apollo Client is configured correctly. The configuration you've shared seems fine, but it's worth double-checking.

5. **React Native Version**: You're using React Native version 0.68.1, which doesn't exist. The latest version is 0.67.2. Please check and correct your React Native version.

6. **Apollo Client Version**: You're using Apollo Client version 3.5.10. Try downgrading to a lower version (like 3.3.21) to see if the issue persists.

7. **GraphQL Server**: Ensure that the GraphQL server is correctly set up to handle the query you're sending. The server might not be able to handle the query, causing the request to hang.

8. **Async/Await**: Try using async/await with useQuery to see if it helps with the issue.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your setup and the issue you're facing.
