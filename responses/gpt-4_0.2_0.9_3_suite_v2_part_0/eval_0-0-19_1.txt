The error message indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is likely because there's a mistake in the package name. 

The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

Please try this and see if it resolves your issue.
