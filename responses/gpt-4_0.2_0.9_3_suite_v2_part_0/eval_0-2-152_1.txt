You should use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you should change your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can use an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast when the element with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript file to work properly.
