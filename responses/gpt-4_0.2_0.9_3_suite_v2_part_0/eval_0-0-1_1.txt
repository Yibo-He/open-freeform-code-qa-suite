The issue you're experiencing could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Make sure you have the correct scripts in your `package.json` file. Vercel uses these scripts to build and start your application. A typical Next.js `package.json` might look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using the file-based routing correctly. For example, a file named `pages/posts/[id].js` will match `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, etc. But it won't match `/posts/1/comments`, for example.

3. **Check your public directory:** If you're using a public directory for static files, make sure the files are there and the paths are correct. The public directory is served at the root of your application, so `public/my-file.txt` can be accessed at `/my-file.txt`.

4. **Check your custom server:** If you're using a custom server, it might not work with Vercel, as Vercel is designed to work with the default Next.js server. If you need a custom server, you might need to look into other hosting options.

5. **Check your build output:** When you run `yarn run build`, check the output to see if there are any errors or warnings that might indicate what's going wrong.

6. **Check your Vercel logs:** After deploying, check the logs in the Vercel dashboard. They might contain useful information about what's going wrong.

If none of these suggestions help, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your issue and asking for help on the Next.js GitHub or on the Vercel support.
