Sure, the problem with your code is that you're trying to use the same key for two different types of properties. You can solve this by creating an intersection type, which combines multiple types into one. Here is the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit has a numeric property and each color has a boolean property.
