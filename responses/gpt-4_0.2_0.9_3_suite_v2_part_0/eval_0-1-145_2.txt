The `truncate` utility in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` on an element. Because of the `white-space: nowrap`, it doesn't work for multiline text.

If you want to truncate text to a specific number of lines, you will need to use some custom CSS. Here is an example of how you can truncate text to 2 lines:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-2">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

And in your CSS:

```css
.line-clamp-2 {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

This uses the `-webkit-line-clamp` property, which is not officially part of the CSS specification, but is supported in most modern browsers. It specifies the maximum number of lines in a block container.

Please note that this solution will not work in all browsers, as `-webkit-line-clamp` is not a standard CSS property.

If you are using Tailwind CSS v2.2.0 or later, you can use the `line-clamp` utility to truncate text after a certain number of lines:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-2">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, `line-clamp-2` will truncate the text after 2 lines.
