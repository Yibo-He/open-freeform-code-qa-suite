The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you need to provide the correct relative path to it in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

Here, `project: "tsconfig.json"` is telling ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you need to provide the correct path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a `config` directory, you would need to change it to:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a `config` directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in the root directory, you would need to change it to:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./config/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

Adjust the path according to your project structure. This should resolve the parsing error you're seeing.
