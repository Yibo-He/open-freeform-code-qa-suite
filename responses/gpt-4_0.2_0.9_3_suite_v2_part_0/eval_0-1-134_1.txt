It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that provides shortcuts for generating HTML and CSS code. 

The `.classname` shortcut you mentioned is one of Emmet's features. When you type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, it should expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that either:

1. You don't have Emmet installed or enabled in your text editor.
2. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet.
3. You're not using the shortcut correctly.

To resolve this:

1. Check if your text editor supports Emmet and if it's installed and enabled. If you're using a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Emmet is built-in and enabled by default. For other editors, you might need to install it manually.

2. Make sure you're using the shortcut correctly. You should type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, not `Enter`.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your text editor and the exact steps you're taking, and I'll be happy to help further.
