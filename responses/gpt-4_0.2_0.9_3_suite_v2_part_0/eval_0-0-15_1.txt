Sure, the issue is that you're mocking the `API` class as an object, not as a class. Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the `API` class. It returns a new function (which can be used as a constructor) each time it's called. This function, when invoked with the `new` keyword, returns an object with a `someMethod` function, just like the real `API` class.
