For React 17, you can use the package `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. It's an unofficial adapter for Enzyme to use with React 17 since there's no official adapter yet. Here's how you can modify your code:

First, install the adapter using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your setup file like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.
