The `EINTEGRITY` error is related to the integrity checksum of a package. This error occurs when the locally installed package's checksum doesn't match the checksum specified in the package's `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Clear the npm cache**: The npm cache might be corrupt. You can clear it using the command `npm cache clean --force`. After running this command, try to install the package again.

2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file**: Sometimes, the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file might be causing the issue. You can delete them using the commands `rm -rf node_modules` and `rm package-lock.json`. After deleting these, try to install the package again.

3. **Update npm**: The npm version you're using might be causing the issue. You can update npm using the command `npm install -g npm@latest`. After updating npm, try to install the package again.

4. **Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`**: The `npm ci` command is similar to `npm install`, but it's meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment. It can be faster than `npm install` because it skips certain user-oriented features. It's also more strict than `npm install` because it doesn't update the `package-lock.json` file.

5. **Check your network connection**: The network connection might be causing the issue. If you're behind a proxy, make sure that your proxy settings are correct. If you're not behind a proxy, try to switch to another network and see if the issue persists.

6. **Check the package's `package.json` file**: The issue might be with the package itself. Check the package's `package.json` file and see if there's anything unusual. If you find anything unusual, you might need to contact the package's maintainer.

Remember to run `npm install` after each step to check if the issue has been resolved.
