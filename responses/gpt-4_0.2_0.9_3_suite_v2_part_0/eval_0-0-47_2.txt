In TypeScript, you can define an inline type for an array of objects as follows:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

The `[]` should be placed after the object type definition, not before. This indicates that `products` is an array of objects, each with properties `name`, `price`, and `description`.
