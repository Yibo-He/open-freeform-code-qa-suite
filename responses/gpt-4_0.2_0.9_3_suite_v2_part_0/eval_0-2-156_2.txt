Based on your HTML structure, it seems like the "Stop Game" button is inside the `#GameRunning` div, which might be positioned behind the game frame. 

You can try the following methods to move the stop button at the top and align it with the begin button:

1. **Change HTML structure**: You can move the `#GameRunning` div to be next to the `#GameStopped` div. This way, the "Stop Game" button will be next to the "Begin Game" button.

2. **CSS Flexbox**: You can use CSS Flexbox to align the buttons. Add `display: flex;` to the parent div (`#DanceScoreboard`) and then use `align-items: flex-start;` to align the buttons at the top. 

Here is the CSS code:

```css
#DanceScoreboard {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
}
```

3. **CSS Grid**: Alternatively, you can use CSS Grid to align the buttons. Add `display: grid;` to the parent div (`#DanceScoreboard`) and then use `align-items: start;` to align the buttons at the top.

Here is the CSS code:

```css
#DanceScoreboard {
  display: grid;
  align-items: start;
}
```

4. **CSS Positioning**: If the above methods do not work, you can use CSS positioning. You can position the `#GameRunning` div absolutely and then use `top` and `left` properties to position it at the top.

Here is the CSS code:

```css
#GameRunning {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

Remember to adjust the `top` and `left` values according to your layout.
