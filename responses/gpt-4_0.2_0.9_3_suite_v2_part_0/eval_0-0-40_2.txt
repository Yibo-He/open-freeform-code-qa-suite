The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and WSL versions of Node.js and npm. When you're running the `npm -v` command, it's trying to execute the Windows version of npm, but it's running in the WSL environment, which is causing the error.

You can solve this issue by changing the order of the directories in your PATH environment variable. You want to make sure that the WSL directories come before the Windows directories.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use nano, vim, or any other text editor you prefer. Here's how you can open it with nano:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
# put WSL directories before Windows directories
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | awk -v RS=: -v ORS=: '/\/mnt\/c\/Program Files\/nodejs/ {next} {print}' | sed 's/:*$//')
```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Close your terminal and open a new one.

5. Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should display the version of npm installed in your WSL environment, not the Windows one.

Remember to replace `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs` with the actual path to your Node.js installation if it's different.
