The error you're seeing is due to the `:key` attribute in your `v-for` loop. Vue.js requires a unique key attribute for each item in a list for it to track each node's identity. This is necessary for Vue to be able to efficiently update the DOM when the list changes.

The `:key` attribute should be a string or a number, but in your case, you're using an object (`comment`), which is a non-primitive value. This is what Vue is warning you about.

Assuming each comment has a unique id, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Just remember that using the index as a key is a last resort, as it can lead to issues if the order of items changes. It's always better to use a unique identifier if one is available.
