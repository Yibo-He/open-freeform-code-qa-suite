Your code seems fine at first glance. However, there are a few things you could check to debug this issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, the issue could be as simple as a network problem.

2. **Server Availability**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. Try to access the URL directly in your browser to see if it's up and running.

3. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "3.3.21") and see if the issue persists.

4. **Error Handling**: You're logging the `error` object, but it might not be providing useful information. Try logging `error.message` instead to get a more detailed error message.

5. **GraphQL Query**: There might be an issue with your GraphQL query. Try running the query directly in a GraphQL playground (like the one at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io') to see if it's working as expected.

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using a debugger like React Native Debugger, ensure that 'Enable Network Inspect' is enabled. This allows you to inspect network requests and responses, which can help you debug the issue.

7. **React Native Version**: You're using React Native version "0.68.1", but as of now, the latest stable version is "0.67.3". This might be a typo, but if it's not, try downgrading to a stable version.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about the issue, such as any error messages you're seeing and the behavior you're observing.
