The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires Popper.js for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

To fix this, you need to install Popper.js. You can do this using npm (Node Package Manager). Here's how:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

This command will install Popper.js and add it to your project dependencies.

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it into your project. Here's how:

1. Open the JavaScript file where you're importing Bootstrap.

2. Add the following line at the top of the file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

3. Then, import Bootstrap:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap';
```

Now, your project should compile without the "Module not found: Can't resolve 'popper.js'" error.
