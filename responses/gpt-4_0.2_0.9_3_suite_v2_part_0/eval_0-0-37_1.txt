Sure, you can define optional parameters in NestJS by using a question mark `?` after the parameter name in the route definition. However, you cannot define optional parameters in the middle of a route. They must be at the end of the route.

Here is the revised route pattern:

```typescript
@Get('route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?')
```

This route will match:

- `route/aa/config`
- `route/aa/config/bb`
- `route/aa/config/bb/cc`

Please note that `OptionalParam2` and `OptionalParam3` are optional and can be omitted. However, if `OptionalParam3` is provided, `OptionalParam2` must also be provided.
