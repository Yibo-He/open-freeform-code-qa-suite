Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It doesn't directly provide a way to target child elements like you would in traditional CSS with the child combinator (`>`).

However, you can create a custom CSS file where you define these specific styles and then use Tailwind's `@apply` directive to apply utility styles to your custom class.

Here's an example:

```css
/* In your custom CSS file */
.section-child {
  @apply some-tailwind-utilities;
}

/* In your HTML */
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-child">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, replace `some-tailwind-utilities` with the Tailwind CSS utility classes you want to apply to the direct children of the `.section` div.

Remember to include your custom CSS file in your project and ensure it's being processed by Tailwind, typically done in your `tailwind.config.js` file.
