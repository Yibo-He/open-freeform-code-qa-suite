Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` in the `Profile Folder` row.

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder and name it `chrome`.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. Make sure the file extension is `.css`.

4. Open the `userChrome.css` file in a text editor and paste the following code:

    ```css
    :root {
        --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
    }
    ```

    This code reduces the padding around menu items. You can adjust the `4px 8px` values to your liking. The first value is the vertical padding (top and bottom) and the second value is the horizontal padding (left and right).

5. Save the `userChrome.css` file and close it.

6. Now, you need to tell Firefox to use your custom CSS. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

7. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

8. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

Please note that modifying internal files can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally not recommended unless you know what you're doing. Always make a backup of your profile folder before making any changes.
