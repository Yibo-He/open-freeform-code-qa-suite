The error you're seeing is because ESLint wants you to name the function that you're using to render the text. You can solve this by assigning the function to a variable and then setting the `displayName` property on that variable. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
const renderGroup = ({ text }) => <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;
renderGroup.displayName = 'renderGroup';

const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: renderGroup,
    },
];
```

In this code, `renderGroup` is a function that takes an object with a `text` property and returns a React element. The `displayName` property is set to the string `'renderGroup'`, which should satisfy ESLint.

If you want to disable the rule for the entire file, you can add `/* eslint-disable react/display-name */` at the top of your file. However, it's generally better to fix the issue rather than disabling the rule.
