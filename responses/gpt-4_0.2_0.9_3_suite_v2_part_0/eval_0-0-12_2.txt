The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not correct.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Check your username and password**: Make sure that the username and password you are using are correct. The username should be your full email address, and the password should be your Gmail password.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You can change this by enabling "Less secure apps" in your Gmail account. Here is how you can do it:

    - Go to your Google Account.
    - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
    - On the bottom of the page, in the Less secure app access panel, click Turn on access.
    - If you don't see this setting, your administrator might have turned off less secure app account access.

3. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you might need to use an app password instead of your regular password. You can generate an app password in your Google account settings. Here is how you can do it:

    - Go to your Google Account.
    - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
    - Under "Signing in to Google," click App Passwords. You might need to sign in.
    - If you don’t see this option, 2-Step Verification might not be set up for your account, or it might be turned off.
    - At the bottom, click Select app and choose the app you’re using.
    - Click Select device and choose the device you’re using.
    - Click Generate.
    - Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
    - Click Done.

Once you have generated your App Password, use it in your nodemailer configuration instead of your regular password.

Please note that exposing your email and password in the code is not a good practice. Consider using environment variables to store such sensitive information.
