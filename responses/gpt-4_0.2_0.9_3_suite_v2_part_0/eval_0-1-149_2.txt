Sure, you can achieve this by using Tailwind CSS's `group-hover` variant. This variant is used to style an element when its parent is being hovered over.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group">
    <span class="text-sky-600 transition-all duration-300">Link</span>
    <span class="block w-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, the width of the second `span` is initially set to `0` and then expanded to `full` when the parent `a` tag is hovered over. The `transition-all` and `duration-500` classes ensure a smooth transition effect.

Please note that for `group-hover` to work, you need to enable it in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) like so:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

This tells Tailwind to generate `group-hover` variants for the `width` utility.
