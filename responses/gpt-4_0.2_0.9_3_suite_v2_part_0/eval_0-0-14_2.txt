The `Switch` component from Ant Design should be used with the `onChange` prop to handle the switch's state changes. Here is the revised version of your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <Switch 
    checkedChildren="Yes" 
    unCheckedChildren="No" 
    onChange={(checked) => form.setFieldsValue({ switch: checked })}
  />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

In this revised code, the `onChange` prop is used to set the value of the switch in the form when it is toggled. The `checked` parameter in the `onChange` function represents the new state of the switch. The `form.setFieldsValue` method is used to manually set the value of one or more fields in the form.
