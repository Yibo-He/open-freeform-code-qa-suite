The error you're seeing is because `req.logout()` is not a function in Express.js by default. It's added by Passport.js when you use it as a middleware. 

However, in your case, it seems like the `req.logout()` function is not available when you're trying to use it. This could be due to a variety of reasons, but most commonly it's because the request is not authenticated when you're trying to call `req.logout()`.

To fix this issue, you can add a check to see if the user is authenticated before calling `req.logout()`. Here's how you can modify your `/logout` route:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        req.logout();
        res.redirect("/");
    } else {
        res.status(403).send('Not logged in');
    }
});
```

In this code, `req.isAuthenticated()` checks if the user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, it calls `req.logout()` to log out the user and then redirects the user to the home page. If the user is not authenticated, it sends a 403 status code with a message 'Not logged in'.
