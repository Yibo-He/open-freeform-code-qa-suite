The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find your `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, but it's not there.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option in `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path to it. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change `"tsconfig.json"` to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // or the correct relative path to your tsconfig.json file
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing. If it doesn't, please double-check the location of your `tsconfig.json` file and adjust the path in the `project` option accordingly.
