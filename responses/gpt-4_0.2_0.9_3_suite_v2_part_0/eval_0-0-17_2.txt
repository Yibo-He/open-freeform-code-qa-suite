Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": ({ state, dispatch }) => {
          console.log("good");
          // prevent the default "enter" behavior
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, `Keymap` is an extension that allows you to bind keyboard shortcuts to commands. You need to import it from `prosemirror-commands`. The `"Enter"` key is being bound to a function that logs "good" to the console and then prevents the default "enter" behavior (which is to insert a new line).
