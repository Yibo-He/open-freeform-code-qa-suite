Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode by using the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme`. This feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here's a basic example:

```css
/* Light mode */
body {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

In this example, the body of the webpage will be white with black text by default. If the user has set their system to use a dark color scheme, the media query will apply and the body will be black with white text.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1 and later, Chrome 76 and later, and Firefox 67 and later. Please note that this will only work if the user has set their system to use a dark color scheme. If they have not, or if their browser does not support the `prefers-color-scheme` feature, the webpage will use the default light color scheme.
