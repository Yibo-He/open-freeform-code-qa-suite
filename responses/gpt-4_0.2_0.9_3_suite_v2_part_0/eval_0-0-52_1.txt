Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.
2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.
3. Delete the line that contains the package.
4. Save the `package.json` file.
5. Run `npm install` in your terminal. This will update your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file based on the changes you made in the `package.json` file.

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove the package:

- If you are using npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

- If you are using yarn, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

These commands will remove the package from the `node_modules` folder, `package.json` file, and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
