Sure, you can use the `keydown` event listener and check if the key pressed is "Enter". Here is the revised code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": ({ state, dispatch }) => {
          console.log("good");
          // prevent the default "Enter" behavior
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

Please note that you need to import `Keymap` from `prosemirror-commands` at the top of your file:

```javascript
import { Keymap } from 'prosemirror-commands';
```

This code will listen for the "Enter" key and execute `console.log("good")` when it is pressed.
