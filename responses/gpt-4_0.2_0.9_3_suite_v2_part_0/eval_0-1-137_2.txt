The error you're getting is because you are importing the `variables` file before you declare your new `$theme-colors` map. The `variables` file already contains a `$theme-colors` map, and when you import it, it tries to convert the map to RGB, which fails because your map is not yet declared.

To fix this, you should declare your `$theme-colors` map before importing the `variables` file, like this:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
  // add other colors if needed
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This way, when the `variables` file is imported, your `$theme-colors` map is already declared and the conversion to RGB will succeed.

Also, make sure you're using a valid color value for your `primary` color. It should be a valid CSS color, like `#ff0000` for red, or `#00ff00` for green, etc.

If you want to override other default colors, you should include them in your `$theme-colors` map as well. Here's an example:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #ff0000, // red
  "secondary": #00ff00, // green
  // add other colors if needed
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This will set the primary color to red and the secondary color to green.
