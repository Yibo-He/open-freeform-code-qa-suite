You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button::after` pseudo-element in your CSS. This is the element that Bootstrap uses to create the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* Bootstrap 5 uses this for the arrow */
    color: green;
}
```

Please note that this will change the color of the arrow for all accordion buttons. If you want to change the color for a specific button, you should add a class or id to that button and then target it in your CSS.

For example:

```html
<button class="accordion-button my-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
    name and surname
</button>
```

And then in your CSS:

```css
.my-button::after {
    color: green;
}
```

This will only change the color of the arrow for the button with the class `my-button`.
