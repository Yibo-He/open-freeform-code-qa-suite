The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for a single line of text. If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach.

Unfortunately, Tailwind CSS does not currently support multi-line text truncation out of the box. You'll need to use a custom CSS solution. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```css
.truncate-2-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This solution uses the `-webkit-line-clamp` property, which is not officially part of the CSS specification, but is supported in most modern browsers. It specifies the maximum number of lines in a block container.

Please note that this solution will not work in Internet Explorer.
