The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and WSL versions of Node.js and npm. When you installed Node.js on WSL, it also installed npm. However, when you try to run npm, it's trying to use the Windows version, which won't work in the WSL environment.

You can solve this issue by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

This line will ensure that the WSL versions of Node.js and npm are found first when you run `node` or `npm`.

After adding this line, you need to reload your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file by running:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions installed on WSL.
