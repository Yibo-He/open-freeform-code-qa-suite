The `Switch` component from Ant Design should be used with `onChange` prop to handle the state changes. Here is how you can revise your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <Switch 
    checkedChildren="Yes" 
    unCheckedChildren="No" 
    onChange={(checked) => form.setFieldsValue({ switch: checked })}
  />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

In this code, `onChange` is used to set the form field value when the switch is toggled. The `checked` parameter represents the current state of the switch. When the switch is toggled, the form field value is updated with the current state of the switch.
