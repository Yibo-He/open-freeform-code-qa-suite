Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with `div.section > div`.

However, you can apply Tailwind CSS classes directly to the child `div` elements you want to style. For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div>
  <div class="p-4">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the first child `div` has a blue background and white text, and the second child `div` has padding on all sides.

If you need to apply styles based on parent-child relationships, you may need to use traditional CSS alongside Tailwind. You can use `@apply` directive in your CSS to use Tailwind's utility classes:

```css
div.section > div {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
}
```

This will apply the `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` styles to direct children `div` of `div` with class `section`.
