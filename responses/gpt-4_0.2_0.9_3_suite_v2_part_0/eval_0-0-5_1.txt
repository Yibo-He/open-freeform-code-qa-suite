The error log you provided indicates that `node-gyp` is unable to find Python in your system's PATH. `node-gyp` is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, which requires Python to work.

Here's how you can fix this issue:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't installed Python yet, you need to install it. You can download it from the official Python website. `node-gyp` requires Python 2.7.x, so make sure to install that version. Python 3.x is not supported.

2. **Add Python to PATH**: After installing Python, you need to add it to your system's PATH. Here's how you can do it:

    - Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
    - Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
    - Click Environment Variables...
    - Select PATH in the System variables section
    - Click Edit
    - Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example, if you installed Python to `C:\Python27\`, then you would add `C:\Python27\` to the end of the PATH.

3. **Reinstall node-gyp**: After Python is properly installed, you should reinstall `node-gyp` to make sure it can find Python. You can do this by running `npm install -g node-gyp` in your command line.

4. **Rebuild node-sass**: Finally, you should rebuild `node-sass` by running `npm rebuild node-sass` in your command line.

After following these steps, your build should work. If you still encounter issues, please let me know.
