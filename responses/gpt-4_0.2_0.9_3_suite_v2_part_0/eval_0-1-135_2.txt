Yes, Safari has some issues with `height: auto;` on flex items. To fix this, you can use `align-self: flex-start;` on the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which is vertical by default, and prevent it from stretching.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make the image display as expected in Safari.
