You can use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can use an event handler. Here is an example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
    $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

In this example, the toast will show when the element with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. If you haven't already included these, add the following lines to your HTML file:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to replace the version numbers in the URLs with the version of Bootstrap you are using.
