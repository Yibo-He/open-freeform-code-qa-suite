From the code you've provided, it seems like you're doing everything correctly. However, there are a few things that could be causing the issue:

1. **Network Issues**: The Apollo Client might be unable to reach the server due to network issues. You can check this by trying to access the server URL directly in your browser or using a tool like Postman.

2. **Server Issues**: The server might be down or not responding correctly. You can check the server logs or contact the server administrator to see if there are any issues.

3. **Incorrect Server URL**: The server URL you're using might be incorrect. Double-check the URL to make sure it's correct.

4. **CORS Issues**: If your server is on a different domain, you might be running into Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. You can check this by looking at the network tab in your browser's developer tools and seeing if there are any CORS errors. If this is the issue, you'll need to configure your server to allow requests from your domain.

5. **Apollo Client Configuration**: There might be an issue with how you've configured the Apollo Client. You can try creating a minimal example with just the Apollo Client and the `useQuery` hook to see if the issue persists.

6. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. You can try updating to the latest version to see if that fixes the issue.

7. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. You can try updating to the latest version to see if that fixes the issue.
