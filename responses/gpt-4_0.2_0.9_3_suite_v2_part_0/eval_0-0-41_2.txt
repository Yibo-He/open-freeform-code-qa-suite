The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in the user's browser, but it doesn't mean that the user has granted permission for location access. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and it takes two callbacks as arguments: the first one is called when the location is successfully retrieved and the second one is called when an error occurs.

Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the geolocation is available and the user allows access, "Location accessed" will be logged. If the user denies access, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the geolocation is not supported by the browser, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
