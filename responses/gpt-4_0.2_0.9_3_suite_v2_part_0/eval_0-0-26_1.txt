The ESLint error you're seeing is because you're using an anonymous function for the `render` property. ESLint is expecting a named function or a function with a `displayName` property.

You can solve this issue by either disabling the rule for that line or by using a named function. Here are both solutions:

**1. Disabling the rule for that line:**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => ( // eslint-disable-line react/display-name
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

**2. Using a named function:**

```jsx
const renderGroup = text => (
  <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
);

const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: renderGroup,
    }
  ]
```

In the second solution, `renderGroup` is a named function, so ESLint will not complain about a missing `displayName`.
