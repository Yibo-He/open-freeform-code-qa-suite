The `.attrs()` function in styled-components is a chainable method that attaches some props to a styled component. It's a way to automatically pass props or variables to your styled components.

Here's a simple example:

```jsx
const Input = styled.input.attrs(props => ({
  type: 'text',
  size: props.small ? 5 : 10,
}))`
  color: palevioletred;
  font-size: 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
  margin: 0.5em;
  padding: 0.25em 0.5em;
  ::placeholder {
    color: palevioletred;
  }
`;

// Use them like any other React component â€“ pass props, compose them with others
render(
  <div>
    <Input placeholder="A small text input" small />
    <br />
    <Input placeholder="A bigger text input" />
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the `Input` component will always have a `type` of 'text', and its `size` will depend on whether the `small` prop is true or false. 

Without `.attrs()`, you would have to pass these props every time you use the `Input` component:

```jsx
<Input type="text" size={5} placeholder="A small text input" small />
<Input type="text" size={10} placeholder="A bigger text input" />
```

So, `.attrs()` can make your code cleaner and more maintainable by reducing redundancy. It's especially useful when you have default values or static props that don't change. 

Also, `.attrs()` can take a function, which means you can dynamically compute props based on the component's props. This is something you can't do with regular props.
