You can change the accordion arrow color by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This is because Bootstrap 5 uses this pseudo-element to create the arrow.

Here is the CSS code to change the arrow color to green:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

You can add this CSS code to your CSS file or inside a `<style>` tag in your HTML file.

Please note that the `:not(.collapsed)` and `.collapsed` selectors are used to target the accordion button in its different states (expanded and collapsed). If you want the arrow to be green in both states, you need to set the color for both selectors.
