The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you're using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not correct. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect Credentials**: The most common reason is that the username or password is incorrect. Double-check your username and password.

2. **Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You need to allow less secure apps to access your account. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, then to the Security tab, and then turning on access for less secure apps. However, this is not recommended by Google.

3. **Two-Step Verification**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you'll need to generate and use an app password instead of your regular password. You can do this from the Google Account settings, under the Security tab, in the App passwords section.

4. **Display Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may require you to confirm it's you with Display Unlock Captcha. Visit this link to unlock: https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

Please note that exposing your email and password in your code is not a good practice. Consider using environment variables to store these sensitive details.
