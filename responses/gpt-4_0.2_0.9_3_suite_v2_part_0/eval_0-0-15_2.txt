Sure, the issue is that you're returning an object from your mock, but you're trying to use it as a class. You should return a function that returns an object instead. Here's the revised version:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

This way, when you call `new API()`, it will return a new instance of the mock class.
