Yes, you can use the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme` to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* CSS for dark mode */
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* CSS for light mode */
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
```

In this example, the browser will apply the dark mode styles when the user has chosen a dark system theme, and the light mode styles when a light theme is chosen.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 and later versions. For older browsers, you may want to provide a default style (light or dark) outside of these media queries.

Keep in mind that this only works if the user has actually chosen a preference in their system settings. If they haven't, or if the browser doesn't support the `prefers-color-scheme` feature, neither of the styles in the media queries will be applied.
