The error you're encountering is because Bootstrap requires Popper.js for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Popper.js. You can do this by using npm (Node Package Manager). 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

This command will install Popper.js and add it to your project dependencies.

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it into your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your main JavaScript file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

Now, you should be able to compile your project without the "Module not found: Can't resolve 'popper.js'" error.
