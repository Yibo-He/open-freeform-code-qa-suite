It's hard to give a precise solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Vercel uses the `build` script in your `package.json` to build your application. Make sure you have a `build` script and it's correctly set to `next build`.

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file name should be wrapped with square brackets like `[id].js` and you should use `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if you need server-side rendering) to fetch the data for your routes.

3. **Check your file and folder names:** Make sure all your file and folder names are in lowercase. Vercel's routing is case-sensitive, so a file named `About.js` will not match a route like `/about`.

4. **Check your import statements:** Make sure all your import statements are correct. If you're importing a file that doesn't exist or the path is incorrect, it could cause a 404 error.

5. **Check your public directory:** If you're serving static files, make sure they're in the `public` directory and you're referencing them correctly. For example, a file in `public/images/photo.jpg` should be referenced as `/images/photo.jpg`.

6. **Check your custom server:** If you're using a custom server, note that Vercel only supports serverless functions. You might need to refactor your code to use API routes instead.

7. **Check your logs:** If none of the above solutions work, check your deployment logs on Vercel. They might give you more information about what's going wrong.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your code and the exact error message you're seeing.
