Font Awesome 5 has changed the way it handles its font families. Now, it has three different font families: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. 

The `content` property also needs to be updated to match the new unicode for the icon you want to use. 

Here's how you can update your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f105"; /* update this with the new unicode */
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* update this with the correct font family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Font Awesome 5 requires a font weight */
}
```

Please make sure to replace `"\f105"` with the correct unicode for the icon you want to use. You can find the unicode for each icon in the Font Awesome 5 icon gallery.

Also, note that the `font-weight` property is now required. For the free version of Font Awesome 5, the `font-weight` should be `900`. If you're using the Pro version, you can use `300`, `400`, or `900` depending on the style of the icon you want to use (`light`, `regular`, or `solid`, respectively).
