To create an animation after hovering over the link using Tailwind-CSS, you can use the `group-hover` variant and the `transform` property. Here's an example code snippet:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300 relative">
    Link
    <span class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transform scale-x-0 transition duration-500 group-hover:scale-x-100"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we added the `relative` class to the link container and the `absolute` class to the span element to position it relative to the link container. We also added the `scale-x-0` class to the span element to hide it initially.

Then, we added the `group-hover:scale-x-100` class to the span element to scale it horizontally to its full width when the link is hovered over. We also added the `transition duration-500` classes to the span element to animate the scaling effect.

Note that we also added the `transform` property to the span element to enable the scaling effect.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
