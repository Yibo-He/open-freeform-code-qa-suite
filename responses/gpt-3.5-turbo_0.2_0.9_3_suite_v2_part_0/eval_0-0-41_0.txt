Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location permission, the `getCurrentPosition` method will not execute the success callback function and will instead execute the error callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle the case where the user denies the location permission. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

Note that I also added an additional check to handle the case where geolocation is not supported by the user's browser.
