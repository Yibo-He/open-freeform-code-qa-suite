Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location permission, the `getCurrentPosition` function will not execute the success callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle the case when the user denies the permission. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user allows the location permission, the success callback function will execute and "Location accessed" will be logged to the console. If the user denies the permission, the error callback function will execute and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the browser does not support geolocation, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
