When deploying a NextJS app to Vercel, there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

1. Make sure you have a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project. This file is used to configure your NextJS app and is required for deployment to Vercel.

2. Make sure you have specified the correct `target` in your `next.config.js` file. If you are not using an API, you should set the `target` to `serverless`.

Here is an example `next.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

3. Make sure you are using the correct URL when accessing your app on Vercel. The URL should be in the format `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`.

4. If you are using dynamic routes, make sure you are using the correct file naming convention. For example, if you have a dynamic route called `post`, the file should be named `[post].js`.

5. If you are using custom server-side code, make sure you have configured it correctly in your `next.config.js` file.

If you have checked all of these things and are still experiencing issues, you may want to check the Vercel logs for more information about the error.
