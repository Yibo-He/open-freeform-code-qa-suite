The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width or a max-width set. You can add the `max-w-xs` class to the `span` element to limit its width to the equivalent of 20rem (320px) or adjust the value to your preference.

Here's the updated code:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate max-w-xs">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
``` 

This should make the text truncate with an ellipsis if it overflows beyond one line.
