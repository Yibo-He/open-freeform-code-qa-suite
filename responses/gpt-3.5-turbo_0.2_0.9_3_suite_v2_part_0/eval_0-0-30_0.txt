Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17, but you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a community-supported adapter for React 17.

Here is the updated code snippet to use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Make sure to install the adapter package by running `npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`.
