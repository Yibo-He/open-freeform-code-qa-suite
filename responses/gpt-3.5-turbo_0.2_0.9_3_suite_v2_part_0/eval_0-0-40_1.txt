The error message you are getting suggests that there might be an issue with the line endings in the `npm` executable file. Windows and Linux use different line endings, and this can sometimes cause issues when running scripts or executables.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` executable file in a text editor that supports changing line endings, such as Notepad++.
2. In the editor, go to the "Edit" menu and select "EOL Conversion" -> "Unix (LF)".
3. Save the file and try running the `npm -v` command again.

If this doesn't work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set it up correctly.
