Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-4' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the `class` attribute of the `li` element, we added the `pb-4` class only for all the items except the last one. `pb-4` adds a padding-bottom of 1rem (16px) to the element. 

We used a ternary operator to check if the current item is the last one in the `v-for` loop. If it is, we added an empty string to the class attribute, which means no padding-bottom will be added. Otherwise, we added `pb-4` to the class attribute.

Note that you can adjust the padding value by changing the number in the `pb-4` class.
