Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of `,` in the type definition. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit | color]: key extends fruit ? number : boolean
}
```

This creates a mapped type that iterates over each key in the union of `fruit` and `color`. For each key, it checks if it extends `fruit` using a conditional type. If it does, it assigns the value type `number`, otherwise it assigns `boolean`.
