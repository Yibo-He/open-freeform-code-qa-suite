The error message indicates that the build process requires Python to be installed on your system. Here are the steps to fix the issue:

1. Download and install Python 2.7.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Add Python to your system PATH environment variable. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.

   b. Under System Variables, find the PATH variable and click Edit.

   c. Add the path to your Python installation directory (e.g. C:\Python27) to the list of paths. Make sure to separate it from the other paths with a semicolon.

3. Restart your command prompt or IDE to ensure that the PATH changes take effect.

4. Try running the build process again.

If the issue persists, you may need to update your node-gyp version. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

This will install the latest version of node-gyp globally on your system.
