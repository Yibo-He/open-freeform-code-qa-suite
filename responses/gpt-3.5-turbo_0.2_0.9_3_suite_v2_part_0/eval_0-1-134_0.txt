It sounds like you might be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to use shorthand syntax to write CSS, which can save you a lot of time and effort.

To use the shorthand syntax, you need to first install the preprocessor and then compile your code into regular CSS. Here are some steps to get started:

1. Install a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. You can do this using a package manager like npm or by downloading the preprocessor directly from their website.

2. Create a new file with a .scss or .less extension. This will be your preprocessed CSS file.

3. Write your CSS using the shorthand syntax. For example, you can use `.classname { background: red; }` instead of writing out the full `div` tag.

4. Compile your preprocessed CSS into regular CSS using a compiler. This can be done using a command line tool or a plugin for your code editor.

Once you've compiled your preprocessed CSS, you can use it in your HTML just like regular CSS.
