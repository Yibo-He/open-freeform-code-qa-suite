Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-2' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the `class` attribute of the `<li>` element, we added the `pb-2` class only for all items except the last one. This will add a `padding-bottom` of `0.5rem` to all items except the last one, which will create the illusion of a border-bottom. 

Note that we used the ternary operator to conditionally add the `pb-2` class based on whether the current item is the last one or not.
