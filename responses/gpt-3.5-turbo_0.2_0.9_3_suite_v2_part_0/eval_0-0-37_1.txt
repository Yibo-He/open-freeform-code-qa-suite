Sure! Here's the revised route pattern that should work for your requirements:

```
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?
```

This pattern includes two optional parameters, `OptionalParam2` and `OptionalParam3`, which can be included in the URL after the `config` segment. The `?` character after each optional parameter indicates that it is optional.

So, the route will match the following URLs:

- `/route/aa/config`
- `/route/aa/config/bb`
- `/route/aa/config/bb/cc`

Note that the parameter names in the pattern should match the parameter names used in your Nestjs controller method.
