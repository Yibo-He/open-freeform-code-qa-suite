Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox using CSS media queries. 

For Safari, you can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}
```

For Chrome and Firefox, you can use the `@media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2)` media query in combination with the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Here's an example:

```css
@media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}
```

These media queries will apply the specified styles when the user's system is in Dark Mode. You can then use JavaScript to toggle a class on the body element to switch between light and dark mode styles.
