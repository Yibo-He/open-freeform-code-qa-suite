The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of a package fails. This can happen due to various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or a mismatch between the expected and actual checksum of the package.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try installing the package again.
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
3. Upgrade npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try installing the package again.
4. If you are using a private registry, make sure it is properly configured and accessible.
5. Check your internet connection and try again.
6. If none of the above steps work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and the `npm` folder in your home directory (`~/.npm`), then run `npm install` again.

If the issue persists, you can refer to the debug log mentioned in the error message for more information on the specific package that is causing the issue.
