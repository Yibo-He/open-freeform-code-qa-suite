To identify if a div is visible on the viewport, you can use the `Intersection Observer API`. This API allows you to observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.

Here is an example of how you can use the `Intersection Observer API` to get the list of divs inside of `#parent` which are visible on viewport on scroll:

```javascript
const parent = document.querySelector('#parent');
const divs = parent.querySelectorAll('div');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      console.log(`Div with id ${entry.target.id} is visible on viewport`);
    }
  });
});

divs.forEach(div => {
  observer.observe(div);
});
```

This code creates a new `IntersectionObserver` instance and observes each div inside of `#parent`. When a div is intersecting with the viewport, the `isIntersecting` property of the `entry` object is set to `true`, and you can log a message to the console indicating that the div is visible on the viewport.

To use the `Intersection Observer API`, you don't need to install any npm modules. It is a built-in API in modern browsers.
