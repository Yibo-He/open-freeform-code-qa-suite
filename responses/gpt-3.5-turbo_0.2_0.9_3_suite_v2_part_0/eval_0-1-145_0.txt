To use the `truncate` class in TailwindCSS, you need to make sure that the parent element has a fixed width or a max-width set. This is because the `truncate` class uses `overflow: hidden` and `text-overflow: ellipsis` to truncate the text, and these properties only work when there is a limit to the width of the element.

Here's an example of how you can fix your code:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block w-40">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, I've added the `w-40` class to the parent `div` element to set a fixed width of 40rem. You can adjust this value to fit your needs. Now, the `truncate` class will work as expected and truncate the text with an ellipsis if it overflows beyond the width of the parent element.
