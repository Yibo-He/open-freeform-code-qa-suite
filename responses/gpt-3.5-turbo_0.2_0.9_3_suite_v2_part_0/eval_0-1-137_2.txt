The issue seems to be with the format of the `$theme-colors` map. The values in the map should be in valid CSS format, which means they should be enclosed in quotes and end with a semicolon.

Try updating your `$theme-colors` map to the following format:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": "#0d6efd",
  "secondary": "#6c757d",
  "success": "#198754",
  "info": "#0dcaf0",
  "warning": "#ffc107",
  "danger": "#dc3545",
  "light": "#f8f9fa",
  "dark": "#212529"
);
```

Make sure to include the quotes and semicolons for each color value. This should resolve the invalid CSS value error you're seeing.
