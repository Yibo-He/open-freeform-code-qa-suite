It seems that the issue is related to the network configuration. The `uri` you are using in the `ApolloClient` is not working properly. 

You can try changing the `uri` to a different endpoint. For example, you can use the following endpoint:

```
https://countries.trevorblades.com/
```

This endpoint provides a GraphQL API that returns information about countries. You can modify your `ApolloClient` configuration to use this endpoint:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Then, modify your `EXCHANGE_RATES` query to use the `name` and `currency` fields provided by this API:

```javascript
const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
    query GetExchangeRates {
        countries {
            name
            currency
        }
    }
`;
```

This should allow you to fetch data using `useQuery` without any issues.
