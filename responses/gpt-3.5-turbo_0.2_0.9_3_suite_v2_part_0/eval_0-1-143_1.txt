You can modify the CSS of Firefox by creating a userChrome.css file. Here are the steps to reduce the spacing between menu items:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for the "Profile Folder" entry.
4. If it doesn't exist already, create a folder named `chrome` in your profile folder.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a file named `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file in a text editor.
7. Add the following CSS code to reduce the spacing between menu items:

```
menupopup > menuitem {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

8. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This should reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox. You can adjust the `padding-block` value to your liking.
