It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic route, but it's hard to say without more information. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your Vercel logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, it should give you a URL where you can view the logs for your app. Check these logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might help you diagnose the issue.

2. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that your `start` script is set up correctly. It should look something like this:

   ```
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "next dev",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "next start"
   }
   ```

   If your `start` script is different, try changing it to match the above.

3. Check your `next.config.js` file: If you don't have a `next.config.js` file, create one in the root of your project. Add the following code to it:

   ```
   module.exports = {
     target: "serverless"
   };
   ```

   This tells Next.js to use the serverless deployment mode, which is required for Vercel.

4. Check your dynamic route: If you're using a dynamic route, make sure that it's set up correctly. For example, if you have a file called `pages/posts/[id].js`, make sure that it exports a `getStaticPaths` function that returns an array of possible values for `id`. If you're using `getServerSideProps` instead of `getStaticProps`, make sure that it's set up correctly.

5. Check your Vercel settings: Make sure that your Vercel settings are set up correctly. For example, make sure that your build command is set to `yarn run build` and that your output directory is set to `out`.

Hopefully one of these steps will help you diagnose and fix the issue.
