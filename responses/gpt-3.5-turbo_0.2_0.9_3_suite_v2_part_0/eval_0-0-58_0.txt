The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error message indicates that the integrity check of the downloaded package has failed. This can happen due to various reasons, such as network issues or corrupted cache. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Upgrade npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

4. If you are using a private registry, check if the registry is up and running, and if the package you are trying to install is available in the registry.

5. If none of the above measures work, try deleting the `~/.npm` folder and then run `npm install` again.

6. If you are still facing the issue, try using `yarn` instead of `npm` to install packages.
