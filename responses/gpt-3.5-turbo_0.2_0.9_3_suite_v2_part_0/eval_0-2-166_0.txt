TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes for common CSS properties. To select direct children of a div with class "section" using TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` (direct child) selector in combination with the `@apply` directive to apply a set of pre-defined classes to the selected elements.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Define the styles for the direct children of .section */
.section > .child {
  /* Your styles here */
}

/* Apply the styles using TailwindCSS */
@layer components {
  .section > .child {
    @apply /* Your TailwindCSS classes here */;
  }
}
```

For example, if you want to apply a margin to the direct children of `.section`, you can use the `mx-4` (horizontal margin of 1rem) and `my-2` (vertical margin of 0.5rem) classes:

```css
@layer components {
  .section > .child {
    @apply mx-4 my-2;
  }
}
```

This will apply a margin of 1rem on the left and right sides, and a margin of 0.5rem on the top and bottom sides of the direct children of `.section`.
