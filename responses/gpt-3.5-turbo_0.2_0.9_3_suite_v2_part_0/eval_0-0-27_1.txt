It seems like the issue is with the URI you are using in your `ApolloClient`. The URI `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` is a demo GraphQL server provided by Apollo Client, and it may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the URI with the endpoint of your own GraphQL server or use a different demo server that is currently working. You can find a list of demo servers in the Apollo Client documentation.

If you don't have your own GraphQL server, you can try using the following URI instead:

```
https://countries.trevorblades.com/
```

This is a demo GraphQL server that provides information about countries. You can modify your `EXCHANGE_RATES` query to fetch data from this server:

```javascript
const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
    query GetExchangeRates {
        countries {
            code
            name
            currency
        }
    }
`;
```

Make sure to update the `uri` property of your `ApolloClient` to use this new URI:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to fetch data using `useQuery`.
