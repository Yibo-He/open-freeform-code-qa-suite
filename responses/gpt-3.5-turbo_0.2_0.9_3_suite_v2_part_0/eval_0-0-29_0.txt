To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook with `userFulfilled` as a dependency. Here's an example of how you can modify the second query code:

```javascript
const [userId, setUserId] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    setUserId(user.id);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user.id]);

const { data: userBio } = useGetUserBioQuery(userId);
```

This code uses the `useState` hook to store the `userId` value, which is initially set to `null`. Then, it uses the `useEffect` hook to update the `userId` value only when `userFulfilled` is `true`. Finally, it uses the `useGetUserBioQuery` hook with `userId` as a parameter to run the second query.
