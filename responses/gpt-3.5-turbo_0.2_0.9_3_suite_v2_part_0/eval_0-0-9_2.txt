Sure! The error message "Error: req#logout requires a callback function" means that the `req.logout()` function requires a callback function as a parameter. You can fix this by passing a callback function to the `req.logout()` function. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

In this code, we added a callback function to the `req.session.destroy()` function. This function is called after the session is destroyed and the user is redirected to the home page (`/`).
