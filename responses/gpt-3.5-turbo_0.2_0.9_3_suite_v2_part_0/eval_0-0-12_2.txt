The error message you are receiving indicates that the login credentials you are using are not being accepted by Gmail. Here are a few things you can try to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security", and then turn on "Less secure app access".

2. Double-check that you are using the correct email address and password for your Gmail account. Make sure that there are no typos or errors in your code.

3. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app password to use instead of your regular password. You can do this in your Google Account settings under "Security" > "App passwords".

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "Display Unlock Captcha" in your Gmail account settings. This will allow you to log in to your account from a new device or location. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security", and then scroll down to "Less secure app access". Click on "Turn on access (not recommended)" and then follow the prompts to enable "Display Unlock Captcha".

Once you have tried these solutions, try running your code again and see if the error persists.
