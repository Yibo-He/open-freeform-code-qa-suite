The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, while the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. In your case, you should change it to:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This assumes that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, one level above the `src` directory.

After making this change, you should restart VSCode and the error should disappear.
