The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Download and install Python 2.7.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/
2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.
3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt window and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH: `python --version`
4. If the command returns the Python version number, then Python is installed correctly and added to the PATH.
5. Try to rebuild your Node.js project again.

If the issue persists, you can try to set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
2. Click on the Environment Variables button.
3. Under System Variables, click on the New button and enter the following information:
   - Variable name: PYTHON
   - Variable value: C:\Python27\python.exe (replace this with the path to your Python executable)
4. Click OK to save the changes.
5. Try to rebuild your Node.js project again.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will fix the issue and allow you to successfully build your Node.js project.
