Currently, there is no `ng rm` command available in Angular CLI to remove packages installed using `ng add`. However, you can remove the package manually by following these steps:

1. Remove the package from `package.json` file by running the command `npm uninstall <package-name> --save`.

2. Remove the package from `angular.json` file by opening the file and removing the entry for the package from the `projects` section.

3. Remove any configuration files or code related to the package from your project.

4. Finally, run `npm install` to update the dependencies.

Note: If you have installed the package globally using `npm install -g <package-name>`, you can remove it using `npm uninstall -g <package-name>`.
