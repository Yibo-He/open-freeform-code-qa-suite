The issue is with the format of the `$theme-colors` variable. In your code, you are defining the `primary` color as `//some color here`, which is not a valid CSS color value. 

To fix this, you need to replace `//some color here` with a valid CSS color value, such as `#007bff` for the default Bootstrap primary color. 

Here's an updated version of your code with a valid `primary` color:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #007bff
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

After making this change, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
