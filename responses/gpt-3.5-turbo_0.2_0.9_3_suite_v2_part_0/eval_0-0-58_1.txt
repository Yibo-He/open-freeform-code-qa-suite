The `EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of a package fails. This error can be caused by various reasons, including network issues, corrupted cache, or package tampering. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.
2. Upgrade to the latest version of npm by running `npm install -g npm@latest`.
3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
4. Check your internet connection and try running `npm install` again.
5. If you are using a private registry, make sure it is properly configured and accessible.
6. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
