To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook and add `user.id` as a dependency. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const [userBio, setUserBio] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled && user) {
    const { data } = await useGetUserBioQuery(user.id).unwrap();
    setUserBio(data);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user]);
```

This code uses the `useState` hook to store the result of the second query. The `useEffect` hook is used to run the second query only after the `user` object is fulfilled and available. The `unwrap` method is used to extract the data from the query result. Finally, the `setUserBio` function is used to update the state with the result of the second query.
