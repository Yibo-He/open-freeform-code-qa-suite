This error occurs because Bootstrap 4 requires Popper.js as a dependency. To fix this error, you need to install Popper.js as a dependency in your project. 

You can install Popper.js using npm by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install popper.js --save
```

Once you have installed Popper.js, you need to import it in your JavaScript file before importing Bootstrap. You can do this by adding the following line of code at the top of your JavaScript file:

```
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

After importing Popper.js, you can then import Bootstrap as usual:

```
import 'bootstrap';
```

This should resolve the "Module not found: can't resolve popper.js" error.
