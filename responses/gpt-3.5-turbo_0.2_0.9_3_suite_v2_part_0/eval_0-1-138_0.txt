Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox by checking the value of the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature. 

Here's an example of how to check for Dark Mode in CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}
```

You can also check for Dark Mode in JavaScript by using the `matchMedia` method:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // user is in dark mode
} else {
  // user is not in dark mode
}
```

Note that the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature is currently only supported in the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
