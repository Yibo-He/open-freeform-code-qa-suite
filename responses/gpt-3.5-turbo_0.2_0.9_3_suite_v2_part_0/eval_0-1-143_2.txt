You can modify the CSS of Firefox by creating a userChrome.css file. Here are the steps to reduce the spacing between menu items:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for "Profile Folder" under "Application Basics".
4. If it doesn't exist, create a folder named `chrome` in your profile folder.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a file named `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file with a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .subviewmenu {
  padding-block: 0px !important;
}
```

7. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This code targets the submenus of the Firefox menu (also known as the "hamburger menu") and sets the padding between menu items to 0 pixels. You can adjust the value of `padding-block` to your liking.
