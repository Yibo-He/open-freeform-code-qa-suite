The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works when the element has a fixed width. You can add the `max-w-xs` class to limit the width of the element to `20rem` (320px) and make the `truncate` class work as expected.

Here's the updated code:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate max-w-xs">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This should truncate the text and add an ellipsis at the end if it overflows the container. You can adjust the `max-w-xs` class to fit your desired width.
