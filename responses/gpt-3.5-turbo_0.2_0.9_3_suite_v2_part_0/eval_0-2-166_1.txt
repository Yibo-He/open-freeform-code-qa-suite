TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It does not provide a way to select direct children using a class selector like `div.section > div`.

However, you can achieve the same effect by using the `first-child` and `last-child` pseudo-classes in combination with the `border` utility class. Here's an example:

```
<div class="section">
  <div class="border-b">First child</div>
  <div class="border-b">Second child</div>
  <div>Last child</div>
</div>
```

In this example, we're using the `border-b` utility class to add a bottom border to each child element. We're also using the `first-child` and `last-child` pseudo-classes to remove the bottom border from the first and last child elements, respectively.

Here's the CSS that TailwindCSS generates for this example:

```
.section > .border-b {
  border-bottom-width: 1px;
  border-bottom-style: solid;
}
.section > .border-b:first-child {
  border-bottom: none;
}
.section > .border-b:last-child {
  border-bottom: none;
}
```

This CSS applies a bottom border to all child elements with the `border-b` class, and then removes the bottom border from the first and last child elements using the `first-child` and `last-child` pseudo-classes.
