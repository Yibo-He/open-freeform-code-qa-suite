To create an animation after hovering over the link using Tailwind-CSS, you can use the `group-hover` variant and the `transform` property to scale the `span` element. Here's an example code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300 relative">
    Link
    <span class="block absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transform scale-x-0 transition duration-500 group-hover:scale-x-100"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we added the `relative` class to the link container to make the `span` element positioned absolutely relative to it. We also added the `scale-x-0` class to the `span` element to make it invisible and the `transition` class to make the animation smooth.

Then, we added the `group-hover:scale-x-100` class to the `span` element to scale it to its full width when the link is hovered over.

You can adjust the `duration` and `scale-x` values to your liking to achieve the desired animation effect.
