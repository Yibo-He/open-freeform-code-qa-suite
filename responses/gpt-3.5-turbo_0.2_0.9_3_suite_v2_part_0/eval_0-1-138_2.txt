Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox by checking the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. 

Here's an example of how to check for Dark Mode in CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}
```

And here's an example of how to check for Dark Mode in JavaScript:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Dark Mode is enabled
} else {
  // Dark Mode is not enabled
}
```

You can use this information to change your site's design to be Dark Mode friendly.
