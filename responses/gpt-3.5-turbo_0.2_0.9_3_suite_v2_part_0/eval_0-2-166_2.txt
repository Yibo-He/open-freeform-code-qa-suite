TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. To select the direct children of a div with class "section", you can use the `>` selector in combination with the `@apply` directive in your CSS code.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Define a custom class for the direct children of div.section */
.section > div {
  /* Your styles here */
}

/* Use the @apply directive to apply the custom class to your HTML element */
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">
    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Section title</h2>
    <div class="mt-4">
      <p>Paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `section > div` selector targets all direct children of the `div` element with class `section`. You can then define your own styles for this selector, such as background color, padding, font size, etc. Finally, you can use the `@apply` directive to apply the custom class to your HTML element, which will inherit the styles you defined.
