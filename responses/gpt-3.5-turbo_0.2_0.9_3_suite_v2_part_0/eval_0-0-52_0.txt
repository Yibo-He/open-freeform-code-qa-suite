You can remove a package that was added using `ng add` command by using the `npm uninstall` command. 

For example, if you added the `@angular/material` package using `ng add @angular/material`, you can remove it using the following command:

```
npm uninstall @angular/material
```

This will remove the package from your project and also remove any dependencies that were installed along with it.
