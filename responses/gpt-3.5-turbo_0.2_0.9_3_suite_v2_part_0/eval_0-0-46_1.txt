The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a tool used for linting your code. It seems that ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file. 

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the location of your `tsconfig.json` file using the `parserOptions.project` property. However, it seems that the path you have specified is incorrect. 

Make sure that the path to your `tsconfig.json` file is correct. If your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, you can specify the path as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is located in a different directory, you will need to adjust the path accordingly.

Once you have updated the path, save the `.eslintrc.js` file and restart VSCode. The error message should disappear.
