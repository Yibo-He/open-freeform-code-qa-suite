- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image tappable.

- Pressable has some new props, like `android_ripple` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.

- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

So, if you need to customize the touch feedback, like changing the color or shape of the feedback, you should use Pressable. But if you just need a simple opacity change and fade-out animation, TouchableOpacity is a better choice.
