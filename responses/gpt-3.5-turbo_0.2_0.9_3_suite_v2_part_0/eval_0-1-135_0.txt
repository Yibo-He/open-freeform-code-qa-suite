In Safari, the `height: auto` property may not work as expected when the image is inside a nested flexbox element. To fix this issue, you can try adding `align-items: flex-start` to the nested flexbox element. This will align the items to the start of the cross axis, which should prevent the image from being stretched. Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
  align-items: flex-start; /* add this line */
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

With this change, the `height: auto` property should work as expected in Safari.
