You can try adding `align-items: flex-start;` to the `.container` class to fix the issue in Safari. This will ensure that the nested flexbox items are aligned to the start of the cross axis, which should prevent the images from being stretched. Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```
