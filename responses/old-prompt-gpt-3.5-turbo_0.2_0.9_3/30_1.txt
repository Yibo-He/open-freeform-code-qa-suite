This error message indicates that there is a conflict between the root directories of the files that you are trying to sign. This can happen when you have multiple files with the same name in different directories.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Clean your project by going to Build > Clean Project.
2. Rebuild your project by going to Build > Rebuild Project.
3. Check if there are any duplicate files in your project and remove them.
4. Check if there are any conflicting dependencies in your Gradle file and resolve them.
5. Try to generate the signed bundle again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try to invalidate caches and restart Android Studio by going to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart. This will clear the cache and restart Android Studio, which may help resolve the issue.
