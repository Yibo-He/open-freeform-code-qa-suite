Yes, you can delete all the saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method of the `SharedPreferences` class. Here's an example code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

void logout() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
  // other logout related tasks
}
```

In the above code, we first get an instance of the `SharedPreferences` class using the `getInstance()` method. Then we call the `clear()` method on the instance to delete all the saved preferences. Finally, we can perform other logout related tasks.
