To enable IntelliSense for module paths with an alias, you need to configure the `paths` property in your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example configuration for your `jsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["./src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/node_modules/*"]
}
```

In this configuration, we set the `baseUrl` to the current directory, and then define a `paths` property with an alias `@styles`. The value of the `@styles` alias is an array of file paths that match the pattern `./src/styled/*`.

After configuring this, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and get IntelliSense support for it. For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

When you hover over `@styles/Button` in VSCode, you should see a tooltip with the resolved path, and you should be able to click on it to navigate to the file.
