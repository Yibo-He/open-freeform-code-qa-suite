Yes, there is a way to delete all saved shared preferences in Flutter in a single shot. You can use the `SharedPreferences.clear()` method to remove all key-value pairs from the shared preferences.

Here's an example code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// ...

void logout() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
  // Other logout related tasks
}
```

In this code, we first get an instance of the shared preferences using `SharedPreferences.getInstance()`. Then, we call the `clear()` method to remove all saved key-value pairs. Finally, you can perform other logout related tasks as needed.
