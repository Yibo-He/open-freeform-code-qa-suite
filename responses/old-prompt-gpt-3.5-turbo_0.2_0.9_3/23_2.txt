The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Puppeteer is not installed: Make sure that you have installed Puppeteer by running `npm install puppeteer` in your project directory.

2. Chrome/Chromium is not installed: Puppeteer requires a version of Chrome or Chromium to be installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the official website: https://www.google.com/chrome/.

3. Chrome/Chromium is not in the default location: If you have installed Chrome/Chromium in a non-default location, you need to specify the path to the executable when launching Puppeteer. You can do this by passing an object with the `executablePath` property to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

Here's an updated version of your code that includes the `executablePath` property:

```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async function() {
  try {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      executablePath: '/path/to/chrome' // replace with the path to your Chrome/Chromium executable
    });
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.setContent(pdfOutput);
    await page.emulateMedia("screen");
    await page.pdf({
      path: "routes/planiton/pdf/mypdf.pdf",
      format: "A4",
      printBackground: true
    });

    console.log('done');
    await browser.close();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Our Error", e)
  }
})();
```
