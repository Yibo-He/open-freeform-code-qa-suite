This error message usually occurs when there is a mismatch between the signing configuration in your Gradle file and the keystore file you are using to sign the app bundle. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the keystore file you are using is the correct one and make sure it matches the signing configuration in your Gradle file.

2. Try cleaning and rebuilding your project by going to Build > Clean Project and Build > Rebuild Project.

3. If the issue persists, try deleting the .gradle and .idea folders in your project directory and then rebuilding the project.

4. You can also try updating your Gradle version to the latest one by going to File > Project Structure > Project and changing the Gradle version.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try creating a new keystore file and updating your Gradle file with the new signing configuration.

I hope this helps!
