To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen: You can install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Create a Swagger specification file: You can create a Swagger specification file in YAML or JSON format. This file describes the API endpoints, parameters, responses, and other details.

3. Generate the client code: Once you have the Swagger specification file, you can use Swagger codegen to generate the client code. You can use the following command to generate the client code:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-swagger-spec-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-swagger-spec-file>` with the path to your Swagger specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client code in (e.g. java, python, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to save the generated code.

4. Use the generated client code: Once the client code is generated, you can use it to make requests to the REST server. You can import the generated code into your project and use the client methods to make requests to the server.

That's it! You now have a generated REST client that you can use to interact with your REST server.
