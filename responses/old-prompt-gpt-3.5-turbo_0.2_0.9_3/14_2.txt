To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to a public hosting like GitHub pages, you can use the `generate` command provided by Nuxt.js. This command will generate a static version of your website that can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

To generate the static files, run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm run generate
```

This will create a `dist` directory in your project root, which contains all the static files that need to be deployed to your hosting provider.

To deploy your website to GitHub pages, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and name it `<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username.
2. Push the contents of the `dist` directory to the `master` branch of your new repository.
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to process your files and deploy your website.
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io` in your web browser to view your deployed website.

Note that if you have content that depends on user input, you will need to use client-side JavaScript to fetch and display that content. You can use a JavaScript framework like Vue.js or React to build a single-page application that can handle user input and fetch data from an API.
