It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are some additional solutions you can try:

1. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and search for "Library Search Paths". Make sure the paths to the libraries are correct and exist in your project directory.

2. Check if the library files are present: Go to your project's Build Phases and search for "Link Binary With Libraries". Make sure the required library files are present and not red. If they are red, remove them and add them again.

3. Check if the library is installed correctly: Try reinstalling the library using `pod install` or `pod update`. Make sure there are no errors during the installation process.

4. Check if the library is compatible with your Xcode version: Make sure the library is compatible with your Xcode version. You can check the library's documentation or GitHub page for compatibility information.

5. Try cleaning the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder and then try building the project again.

6. Try resetting Xcode: If none of the above solutions work, try resetting Xcode by deleting the DerivedData folder. You can find the folder location in Xcode Preferences > Locations > Derived Data. Delete the folder and restart Xcode.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will solve your problem.
