It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the library paths are correct: Go to your project's Build Settings and check if the paths for the missing libraries are correct. If not, update the paths to the correct locations.

2. Check if the libraries are included in your project: Go to your project's Build Phases and check if the missing libraries are included in the "Link Binary With Libraries" section. If not, add them by clicking the "+" button.

3. Check if the libraries are installed correctly: Check if the missing libraries are installed correctly by running `pod install` or `pod update` in your project directory. If the libraries are not installed correctly, try removing the `Podfile.lock` file and running `pod install` again.

4. Clean and rebuild your project: Clean your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode and then rebuild it by going to Product > Build.

5. Check if the library is compatible with your Xcode version: Check if the library is compatible with your Xcode version. If not, try updating your Xcode version or using a different library.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will work for you.
