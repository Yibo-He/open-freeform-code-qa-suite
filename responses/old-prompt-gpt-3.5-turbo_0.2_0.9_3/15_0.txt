Yes, I can help you with that. Here's the code to complete the `transform` function:

```
from io import BytesIO

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    buf = BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

Explanation:

1. We import `BytesIO` from the `io` module. This allows us to create an in-memory buffer to hold the image data.
2. In the `transform` function, we create a `BytesIO` object called `buf`.
3. We call `savefig` on the input `Figure` object, passing in `buf` as the destination buffer and specifying the format as `'png'`.
4. We reset the buffer position to the beginning using `buf.seek(0)`.
5. We create a `PIL.Image` object by calling `Image.open` on the buffer.
6. We return the `PIL.Image` object.

This code saves the `Figure` object as a PNG image in memory, then opens that image as a `PIL.Image` object. This avoids the need to save the image to disk and then read it back in.
