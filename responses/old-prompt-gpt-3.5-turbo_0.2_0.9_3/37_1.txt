To get the screen height in Android with API level above 30, you can use the following code:

```
val wm = fragmentActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) as WindowManager

fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val insets = windowMetrics.windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.systemBars())
    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom
    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val height = b.height() - insetsHeight
    return height
}
```

This code uses the `WindowMetrics` class to obtain the screen height. The `WindowInsets.Type.systemBars()` parameter is used to get the height of the system bars (status bar and navigation bar). The `insetsHeight` variable is used to subtract the height of the system bars from the total height of the screen. Finally, the `height` variable is returned as the screen height.
