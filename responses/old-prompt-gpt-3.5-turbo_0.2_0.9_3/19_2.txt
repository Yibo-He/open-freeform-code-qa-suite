This error occurs when the operating system's limit for the number of files that can be watched is exceeded. You can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the limit for the number of files that can be watched by the operating system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
   ```

2. If you are using a macOS, you can try increasing the limit for the number of files that can be watched by the system by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=5242880
   sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=524288
   ```

3. If the above solutions do not work, you can try closing any unnecessary applications or processes that may be using up the file watcher limit.

4. Another solution is to use the `watchman` file watcher instead of the default file watcher. You can install `watchman` by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   brew install watchman
   ```

   Once installed, you can start the Metro bundler with the `--watcher` flag set to `watchman`:

   ```
   react-native start --watcher watchman
   ```
