Yes, you can see the result graphs in Visual Studio Code itself by using the Matplotlib interactive mode. You can enable it by adding the following line of code at the beginning of your script:

```python
plt.ion()
```

This will enable interactive mode, which will display the plot inline in the VS Code editor.

Here is the modified code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

plt.ion() # enable interactive mode

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Now, when you run this code, you should see the plot displayed inline in the VS Code editor. If you make any changes to the code, the plot will update automatically.
