Yes, you can use personal access tokens to clone, commit, and push to GitHub repositories. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Generate a personal access token on GitHub with the necessary permissions (e.g. repo, write, etc.).
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username, `<personal_access_token>` with your personal access token, and `<project_name>` with the name of the repository you want to clone.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository using the `cd` command:
   ```
   cd /path/to/cloned/repository
   ```
4. Make changes to the repository and commit them using the following command:
   ```
   git commit --allow-empty -m 'Commit message'
   ```
   Replace `'Commit message'` with a descriptive message for your commit.
5. Push the changes to the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username, `<personal_access_token>` with your personal access token, and `<project_name>` with the name of the repository you want to push to.

Note that you can also use SSH URLs instead of HTTPS URLs for cloning and pushing to repositories.
