The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle` indicates that the `location_web` plugin is missing or not properly configured in your project. 

To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `settings.gradle` file in your project and add the following line:

   ```
   include ':location_web'
   ```

2. Save the file and then run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This will download and install any missing dependencies.

3. If the above steps don't work, you can try adding the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

   ```
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:17.0.0'
   ```

   This will add the necessary dependencies for the `location_web` plugin.

Regarding the second error message `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems that you are trying to display an image using a `Future` object instead of a `String` URL. To fix this error, you can use a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously load the image from the URL returned by `_getUserLocation()` method. Here's an example:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height:
