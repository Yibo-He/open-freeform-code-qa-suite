This error occurs when the Go language server in VSCode is unable to find the package data for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package. This can happen if the package is not installed or if the package data is not in the expected location.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the `redigo` package is installed. You can install it using the following command:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if the package data is in the expected location. The package data should be in the `src` directory of your Go workspace. You can check the location of your Go workspace by running the following command:

   ```
   go env GOPATH
   ```

   This will give you the path to your Go workspace. The `src` directory should be inside this workspace.

3. If the package data is not in the expected location, you can try running the following command to download the package data:

   ```
   go mod download github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   This will download the package data and place it in the correct location.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try restarting VSCode or reloading the Go language server by running the `Go: Restart Language Server` command from the command palette.

After trying these steps, the error should be resolved and you should be able to use intellisense suggestions for the `redigo` package.
