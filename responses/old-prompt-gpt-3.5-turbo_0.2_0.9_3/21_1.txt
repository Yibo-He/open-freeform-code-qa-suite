Yes, I can help you with that. The issue is that the environment variables are not being set correctly. Here's the modified code that should work:

```
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local/
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y --prefix /usr/local/ ujson aiohttp tqdm

import sys
import os

# Add the conda libraries to the system path
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')

# Set the environment variables
os.environ['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin:' + os.environ['PATH']
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/'

import ujson
```

This code adds the conda libraries to the system path and sets the environment variables correctly. It should allow you to import the `ujson` module successfully.
