The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch the browser process. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a missing dependency or a problem with the installation of the Chromium browser.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure that you have installed the required dependencies for Puppeteer to work. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

2. Check that you have installed the correct version of Puppeteer that matches the version of Chromium installed on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm ls puppeteer
   ```

   This will show you the version of Puppeteer that you have installed.

3. If you have installed the correct version of Puppeteer, try reinstalling it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm uninstall puppeteer
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

4. If the above steps do not work, try installing the Chromium browser manually by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm install puppeteer-core
   ```

   This will install the core Puppeteer library without the bundled Chromium browser. You can then specify the path to the Chromium executable when launching Puppeteer, like this:

   ```
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
     executablePath: '/path/to/chromium'
   });
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/chromium` with the actual path to the Chromium executable on your system.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions
