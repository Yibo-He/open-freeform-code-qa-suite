The error message suggests that the Feign client is not able to find a load balancer for load balancing. This is because the `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign` dependency does not include the Ribbon load balancer by default. 

To resolve this issue, you need to add the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency to your project. You mentioned that you have already tried adding this dependency but it did not help. In that case, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have added the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency to your `pom.xml` file as shown below:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Try running your application with the `--debug` flag to see if there are any additional error messages related to the Ribbon load balancer.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try adding the following configuration to your application:

```
@Configuration
public class RibbonConfiguration {

  @Autowired
  IClientConfig ribbonClientConfig;

  @Bean
  public ILoadBalancer ribbonLoadBalancer() {
    return LoadBalancerBuilder.newBuilder().withClientConfig(ribbonClientConfig).build();
  }

}
```

This configuration creates a Ribbon load balancer bean that can be used by the Feign client. Make sure that you have the `@Autowired` and `@Bean` annotations imported correctly.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
