To make VSCode IntelliSense work with an alias, you need to configure the `jsconfig.json` file to include the alias path.

Here's an example of how to configure `jsconfig.json` to include an alias `@styles`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

In this example, we're setting the `baseUrl` to the current directory (`.`) and defining a path alias `@styles/*` that maps to the `src/styled/*` directory.

Once you've configured `jsconfig.json`, you should be able to use IntelliSense to access the `@styles` alias by clicking on it. For example:

```js
import Button from '@styles/Button'; // IntelliSense should work for @styles/Button
```

Note that you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.
