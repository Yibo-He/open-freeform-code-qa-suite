Yes, you can customize the height of `BottomNavigationBar` in Flutter. You can achieve this by wrapping the `BottomNavigationBar` widget with a `SizedBox` widget and setting its height property to the desired value.

Here's an example:

```dart
Scaffold(
  bottomNavigationBar: SizedBox(
    height: 50, // set the desired height here
    child: BottomNavigationBar(
      // your BottomNavigationBar code here
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `BottomNavigationBar` is wrapped with a `SizedBox` widget with a height of 50. You can adjust the height value to your desired height.
