The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle` suggests that the `location_web` plugin is not properly installed or configured in your project. 

To fix this error, you can try the following steps:
1. Open the `settings.gradle` file in your project and add the following line:
```
include ':location_web'
```
2. Save the file and then run the command `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the missing plugin.

Regarding the second error message `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems that you are trying to display a `Future` object as an image. 

To fix this error, you can use a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously load the image from the URL returned by the `_getUserLocation()` method. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

```
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
``` 

This code uses a `FutureBuilder` widget to asynchronously load the image from the URL returned by `_getUserLocation()`. If the `snapshot`
