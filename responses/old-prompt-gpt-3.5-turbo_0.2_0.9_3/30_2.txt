This error occurs when the signing configuration in your build.gradle file is not properly set up. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check your signing configuration in the build.gradle file. Make sure that the keystore file path, alias, and passwords are correct.

2. If you are using a custom keystore file, make sure that it is located in the correct directory.

3. Try cleaning and rebuilding your project. Sometimes, this can help resolve issues related to the build process.

4. If the issue persists, try deleting the .gradle and .idea folders in your project directory and then re-importing the project into Android Studio.

5. If none of the above steps work, try rolling back to the previous version of Android Studio and Gradle build to see if the issue is resolved.
