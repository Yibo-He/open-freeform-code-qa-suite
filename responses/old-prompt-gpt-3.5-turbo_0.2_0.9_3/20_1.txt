I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It's always a good practice to save your work frequently, especially when working with Jupyter Notebook.

Regarding the error message you saw, it's hard to say without more information. However, it's possible that the error message was related to the notebook's kernel. When the kernel encounters an error, it can cause the notebook to become unresponsive or not save properly. 

As for recovering your work, there are a few things you can try:

1. Check the Jupyter Notebook autosave directory: By default, Jupyter Notebook saves a backup copy of your notebook every 120 seconds in a hidden directory called `.ipynb_checkpoints`. You can try opening the most recent checkpoint file in this directory to see if it contains your lost work.

2. Check the trash or recycle bin: If you accidentally deleted the notebook, it may still be in your computer's trash or recycle bin. 

3. Use a file recovery tool: There are several file recovery tools available that can help you recover deleted files. Some popular options include Recuva (for Windows) and Disk Drill (for Mac).

4. Check with your IT department: If you're working on a company computer, your IT department may have backups of your files that they can restore.

I hope one of these options helps you recover your lost work. Good luck!
