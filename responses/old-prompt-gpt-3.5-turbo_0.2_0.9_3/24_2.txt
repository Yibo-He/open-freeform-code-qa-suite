Yes, there are official guidelines for naming getters and setters in Java 14 records. According to the Java Language Specification, the naming convention for the accessor methods generated by a record is as follows:

- The accessor method for a record component named `foo` is named `foo()`.
- The mutator method for a record component named `foo` is named `withFoo()`.

So, if you have a record component named `name`, the generated accessor method would be `name()`. If you want to create a new record with a different name, you would use the `withName(String newName)` method.

It's worth noting that these naming conventions only apply to records. For regular classes, the JavaBeans naming convention (e.g. `getName()`, `setName(String name)`) is still recommended.
