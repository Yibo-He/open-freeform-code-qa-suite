This error occurs because VSCode is unable to find the package data for the `github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` package. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have installed the Redigo package using the following command:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

2. Check if the package is installed in your GoPath. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   ls $GOPATH/src/github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   If the package is installed, you should see the package files listed.

3. If the package is installed, try reloading your VSCode window or workspace. This should refresh the IntelliSense suggestions and resolve the error.

4. If the package is not installed, try reinstalling it using the `go get` command mentioned above.

If none of these steps work, you can try manually adding the package path to your `go.mod` file. To do this, add the following line to your `go.mod` file:

```
require github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis v1.8.0
```

Replace `v1.8.0` with the version of Redigo that you have installed. Save the file and reload your VSCode window or workspace. This should resolve the error and enable IntelliSense suggestions for the package.
