It seems like Xcode is unable to find the required libraries for your project. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the library directories exist: 
   - Go to `/Users/kh/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/om-euxqzibzllbcmndwqrgthdeotiro/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/` and see if the directories for `AFNetworking`, `JSONModel`, `ReactiveCocoa`, `Realm`, `SAMKeychain`, and `Sentry` exist. If not, try rebuilding the project.

2. Check if the libraries are added to your project:
   - Go to your project's `Build Phases` and check if the libraries are added to `Link Binary With Libraries`. If not, add them.

3. Check if the libraries are installed correctly:
   - Try reinstalling the libraries using `pod install` or `pod update`. Make sure there are no errors during installation.

4. Check if the library paths are set correctly:
   - Go to your project's `Build Settings` and check if the library paths are set correctly. Make sure they are set to `$(inherited)`.

If none of these solutions work, try creating a new Xcode project and adding the required libraries again.
