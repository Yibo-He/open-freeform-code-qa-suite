   ```
   git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username, `<personal_access_token>` with your personal access token, and `<project_name>` with the name of the repository you want to push to. The `master` branch is the default branch, but you
