It seems like the issue is related to the version-platform combination of MongoDB. The requested version-platform combination does not exist, which is causing the 403 error. 

You can try specifying a different version of MongoDB in your package.json file. For example, if you are currently using version 4.0.14, you can try downgrading to version 4.0.13 or upgrading to version 4.0.15. 

You can also try specifying a different platform in your package.json file. For example, if you are currently using the win32 platform, you can try using the linux platform instead. 

If neither of these solutions work, you can try using a different package for in-memory MongoDB testing, such as mongodb-memory-server-global.
