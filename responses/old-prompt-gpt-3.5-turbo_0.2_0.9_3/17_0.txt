To enable IntelliSense for module paths with aliases in VSCode, you need to configure the `paths` option in your `jsconfig.json` file.

Here's an example configuration for your `jsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

In this configuration, we set the `baseUrl` to the root directory of our project, and then define a `paths` object with the alias `@styles` and its corresponding path `src/styled/*`. 

With this configuration, you should be able to import modules using the `@styles` alias and have IntelliSense work properly. For example:

```javascript
import Button from '@styles/Button';
```

When you hover over `@styles/Button` in VSCode, it should show you the path to the module and allow you to click on it to open the file.
