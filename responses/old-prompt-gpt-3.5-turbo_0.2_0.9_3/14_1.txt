To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages, you can use the following steps:

1. First, make sure that your website is configured to generate a static site. You can do this by updating the `nuxt.config.js` file with the following code:

```js
export default {
  target: 'static'
}
```

2. Next, install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency using the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

3. Update the `package.json` file with the following code:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "nuxt generate && gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

This will generate the static site and deploy it to GitHub pages.

4. Finally, run the following command to deploy your website:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will generate your website and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository. You can then access your website at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Note that if your website has content that depends on user input, you will need to use client-side JavaScript to fetch and display that content. You can do this using Nuxt.js's built-in `asyncData` or `fetch` methods.
