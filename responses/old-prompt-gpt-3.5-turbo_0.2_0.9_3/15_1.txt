Certainly! Here's one way to do it:

```
from io import BytesIO
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    # Save the figure to a bytes buffer
    buf = BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)

    # Open the image from the buffer using PIL
    img = Image.open(buf)

    return img
```

This code saves the `fig` to a `BytesIO` buffer in PNG format, then opens the image from the buffer using PIL. The `buf.seek(0)` line is necessary to reset the buffer position to the beginning before opening the image.
