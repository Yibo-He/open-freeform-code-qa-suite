It looks like the issue is with the version-platform combination of MongoDB. The requested version-platform combination does not exist. 

You can try specifying a different version of MongoDB in your package.json file. For example, you can try using version 4.2.8 by adding the following line to your package.json file:

```
"mongodb-memory-server-core": "^6.6.0",
"mongodb-memory-server": "^6.6.0",
"mongodb": "^4.2.8"
```

Then, run `npm install` to install the updated packages and try running your tests again.
