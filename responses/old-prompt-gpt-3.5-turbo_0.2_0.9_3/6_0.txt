It sounds like the issue might be related to SSL. By default, jHipster generates a self-signed SSL certificate for development purposes. When you access the app through https, your browser might not trust the certificate and therefore block the connection.

To bypass this issue, you can try accessing the app through http instead of https. Simply go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and see if you can access the app.

If you still want to access the app through https, you can try importing the jHipster SSL certificate into your browser's trusted certificates. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to `https://localhost:8080`.
2. You should see a warning message saying that the connection is not secure. Click on "Advanced" or "Details" to expand the message.
3. Look for an option to "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" or "Add exception". Click on it.
4. Follow the instructions to add the jHipster SSL certificate to your browser's trusted certificates.

Once you have added the certificate, you should be able to access the app through https without any issues.
