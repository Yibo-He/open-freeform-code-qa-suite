The error message suggests that the Puppeteer library is unable to launch a browser instance. This can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that the required dependencies are not installed on your system.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: Puppeteer requires some system-level dependencies to run, such as `libx11-xcb1`, `libxcb1`, `libxcomposite1`, `libxdamage1`, `libxi6`, `libxtst6`, `libnss3`, `libcups2`, `libxss1`, `libxrandr2`, `libasound2`, and `libatk1.0-0`.
