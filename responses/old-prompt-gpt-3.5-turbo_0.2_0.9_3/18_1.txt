This error usually occurs when the Go module cache is corrupted or outdated. To solve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Close VSCode and any running Go processes.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
3. Run `go clean -modcache` to clean the Go module cache.
4. Run `go mod tidy` to update the module dependencies.
5. Reopen VSCode and try importing the package again.

If the error persists, you can try manually deleting the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files in your project directory and running `go mod init` to recreate them. Then, run `go mod tidy` again to update the module dependencies.

If none of these steps work, you can try reinstalling the Redigo package by running `go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis` in your terminal.
