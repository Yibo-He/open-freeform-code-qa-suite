To deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages, you can use the `nuxt generate` command to generate a static version of your website, and then push the generated files to a GitHub repository.

Here are the steps to deploy a Nuxt.js static website to GitHub pages:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and a repository set up for your website.

2. Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

3. In your `nuxt.config.js` file, add the following configuration:

   ```
   export default {
     // ...
     generate: {
       dir: 'docs'
     }
   }
   ```

   This will generate the static files in a `docs` directory instead of the default `dist` directory.

4. In your `package.json` file, add the following scripts:

   ```
   "scripts": {
     // ...
     "deploy": "nuxt generate && gh-pages -d docs"
   }
   ```

   This script will generate the static files and deploy them to GitHub pages.

5. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.

6. Run the following command to deploy your website:

   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This will generate the static files and deploy them to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

7. Finally, go to your GitHub repository settings and set the GitHub pages source to the `gh-pages` branch.

   Your website should now be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.
