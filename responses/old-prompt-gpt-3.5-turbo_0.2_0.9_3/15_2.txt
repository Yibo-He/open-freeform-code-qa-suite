Yes, I can help you with that. Here's the code to complete the `transform` function:

```
from io import BytesIO

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    # Save the figure to a bytes buffer
    buf = BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)

    # Open the image from the bytes buffer using PIL
    img = Image.open(buf)

    return img
```

In this code, we first save the `input` figure to a bytes buffer using `savefig` method of the `Figure` object. We specify the format as `png` since PIL can easily open PNG images. Then, we seek to the beginning of the buffer using `seek` method. Finally, we open the image from the bytes buffer using `Image.open` method of PIL and return it.

Note that we are not saving the figure to disk and then opening it. Instead, we are saving it to a bytes buffer and then opening it using PIL. This avoids the need to write to disk and read from disk, which can be slower and less efficient.
