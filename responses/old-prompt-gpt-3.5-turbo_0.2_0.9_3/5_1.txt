You should modify the `main.ts` file to:

```
import Logo from 'assets/images/logo.png';
```

And modify the HTML file `main.html` to:

```
<img src={Logo.default} alt="" />
```

This is because when you import a file using `import * as`, you are importing it as an object with all the exports of the module as properties. In this case, you need to access the `default` property of the imported object to get the actual value of the module.
