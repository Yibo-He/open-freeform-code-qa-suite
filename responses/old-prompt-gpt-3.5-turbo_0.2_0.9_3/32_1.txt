The error message suggests that the requested version-platform combination of MongoDB does not exist. You can try the following steps to make mongodb-memory-server work as intended:

1. Update the version of mongodb-memory-server to the latest version by running `npm install mongodb-memory-server@latest --save-dev`.

2. Clear the cache by running `npm cache clean --force`.

3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.

4. Reinstall the dependencies by running `npm install`.

5. Run the tests again by running `npm run test`.

If the issue persists, you can try specifying a different version of MongoDB by setting the `binary` option in the `new MongoMemoryServer()` constructor. For example:

```
mongo = new MongoMemoryServer({
  binary: {
    version: '4.0.13'
  }
});
```

This will use version 4.0.13 of MongoDB instead of the latest version.
