This error occurs when the number of files that are being watched by the system exceeds the limit set by the operating system. You can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the limit of the number of files that can be watched by the system. On macOS or Linux, you can run the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
   ```

   This will increase the limit to 524288. You can try increasing it further if needed.

2. If the above solution doesn't work, you can try closing unnecessary applications and processes that may be using up the file watcher limit.

3. Another solution is to use a different file watcher. You can try switching to the watchman file watcher by installing it and then running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   brew install watchman
   ```

   After installing watchman, you can run the following command to start the project:

   ```
   react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

   This should start the project with the watchman file watcher.
