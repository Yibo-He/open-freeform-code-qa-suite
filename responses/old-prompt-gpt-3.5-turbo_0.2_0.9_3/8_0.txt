Sure! Here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
  var newDate = new Date(date.getTime() + date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
  newDate.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return newDate;
}
```

This function takes a `Date` object as an argument and returns a new `Date` object representing the same date and time in UTC. 

The first line creates a new `Date` object that is the same as the original date, but with the timezone offset subtracted. This effectively converts the date to UTC time. 

The second line sets the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds of the new date to zero, since we only want to represent the date in UTC, not the time. 

Finally, the function returns the new `Date` object.
