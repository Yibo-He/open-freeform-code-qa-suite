To generate a REST client using Swagger codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger codegen: You can install Swagger codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/.

2. Create a Swagger specification file: You can create a Swagger specification file in YAML or JSON format. The file should describe the REST API that you want to generate a client for.

3. Generate the client code: Once you have the Swagger specification file, you can use Swagger codegen to generate the client code. The command to generate the client code will depend on the programming language that you want to use for the client. For example, if you want to generate a Java client, you can use the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-swagger-spec-file> -l java -o <output-directory>
```

This command will generate a Java client in the specified output directory.

4. Use the generated client: Once you have generated the client code, you can use it to interact with the REST API that you described in the Swagger specification file. You can import the generated client code into your project and use it to make requests to the server.

Note that Swagger codegen supports many programming languages and frameworks, so you can generate a client for almost any REST API.
