To generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Swagger Codegen: You can install Swagger Codegen by following the instructions on the official website: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

2. Create a Swagger file: You need to create a Swagger file that describes your REST server. You can use the Swagger Editor to create the file: https://editor.swagger.io/

3. Generate the client code: Once you have the Swagger file, you can generate the client code using the following command:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-swagger-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-swagger-file>` with the path to your Swagger file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client code in (e.g. java, python, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to save the generated code.

4. Use the client code: Once the client code is generated, you can use it to make requests to your REST server. You can find examples of how to use the client code in the Swagger Codegen documentation for your chosen language.
