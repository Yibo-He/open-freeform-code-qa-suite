Yes, you can use personal access tokens to clone, commit, and push to a GitHub repository. Here are the steps:

1. Generate a personal access token on GitHub with the necessary permissions (e.g. repo, write:packages, etc.)
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository using your personal access token:

```
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```

4. Navigate to the cloned repository using the following command:

```
cd <project_name>
```

5. Make any changes you want to the files in the repository.
6. Use the following command to commit your changes:

```
git commit --allow-empty -m 'Commit message'
```

7. Finally, use the following command to push your changes to the repository:

```
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Note that you will need to replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your own values.
