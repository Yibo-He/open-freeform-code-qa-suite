This error occurs when there are too many files being watched by the system. You can try increasing the maximum number of files that can be watched by the system.

On macOS or Linux, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

On Windows, you can try running the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | Out-File -FilePath 'C:\ProgramData\Docker\windowsfilter\fs\watchman\\daemon.json' -Encoding ascii -Append
```

After running these commands, try running `react-native start` again and see if the issue is resolved.
