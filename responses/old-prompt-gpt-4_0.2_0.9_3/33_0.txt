The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is because the location package you are using is trying to find its web implementation which is not found. This is because the location package has a federated architecture, meaning it has a separate package for each platform it supports (Android, iOS, Web, etc.). 

To fix this, you can ignore the error if you are not targeting the web platform or you can add the web implementation of the location package in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  location_web: ^1.0.0
```

The second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to load an image from a Future. The `Image.network` widget expects a String URL, but you are providing a Future that will eventually contain a String.

To fix this, you can use a FutureBuilder to wait for the Future to complete and then load the image:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170, 
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              } else {
                if (snapshot.hasError)
                  return Center(child:
