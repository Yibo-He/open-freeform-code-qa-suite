You can set up path aliases in VSCode by modifying your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `jsconfig.json` file. If you don't have one, create it in the root of your project.

2. Add a `compilerOptions` property to the JSON object. This property should be an object with a `baseUrl` and `paths` property.

3. Set `baseUrl` to `"."` (the current directory).

4. Set `paths` to an object where the keys are your path aliases and the values are arrays with the paths the aliases should point to.

Here's an example of what your `jsconfig.json` file could look like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

In this example, `@styles` is the alias for the `src/styled` directory. The `*` at the end of `@styles/*` and `src/styled/*` means that any subdirectory or file in `src/styled` can be imported using the `@styles` alias.

After setting up your `jsconfig.json` file, you should be able to import files from the `src/styled` directory like this:

```javascript
import MyComponent from '@styles/MyComponent';
```

VSCode should be able to provide IntelliSense for these path aliases. If it doesn't, try restarting VSCode.
