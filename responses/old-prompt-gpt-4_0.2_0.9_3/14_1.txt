To deploy your Nuxt.js application as a single page application (SPA) on GitHub pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. Open your `nuxt.config.js` file and set the mode to 'spa':

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to generate a static version of it. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This will create a `dist` directory in your project root. This directory contains a static version of your application.

4. Now, you need to push this `dist` directory to your GitHub repository. You can do this by using the `gh-pages` npm package. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running:

```bash
npm install -g gh-pages
```

5. After installing `gh-pages`, you can deploy your application by running:

```bash
gh-pages -d dist
```

This command pushes the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository. If the `gh-pages` branch doesn't exist yet, it will be created.

6. Finally, you need to configure your GitHub repository to use the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages. You can do this in the settings of your GitHub repository.
