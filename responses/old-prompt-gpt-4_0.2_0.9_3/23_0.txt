The error message you're seeing suggests that Puppeteer is having trouble launching a browser instance. This could be due to a number of reasons, but here are a few common solutions:

1. **Install Puppeteer with bundled Chromium**: By default, Puppeteer downloads and uses a specific version of Chromium. If you didn't install Puppeteer with the bundled Chromium, you can do so with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i puppeteer
    ```

2. **Check your system dependencies**: Puppeteer requires certain system dependencies. If you're on a Linux system, you might need to install these dependencies. Here's a command that installs the necessary dependencies on Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxi6 libxext6 libxtst6 libnss3 libcups2 libxss1 libxrandr2 libasound2 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0
    ```

3. **Run Puppeteer in headless mode**: If you're running your script on a server without a graphical user interface, you might need to run Puppeteer in headless mode:

    ```javascript
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
    ```

4. **Check your path**: Make sure the path to the browser executable is correct. If you're using a custom path, you can specify it when launching Puppeteer:

    ```javascript
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
