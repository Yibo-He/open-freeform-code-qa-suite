The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the location package. It seems like the location package is trying to use the web version of the plugin, but it's not found. 

To fix this, you can try to add the following line to your `settings.gradle` file:

```gradle
include ':app', ':location_web'
```

The second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to use a `Future<String>` as a `String`. 

The `_getUserLocation()` method is asynchronous and returns a `Future<String>`. You can't use it directly as a `String` because it's a `Future`. You need to wait for the `Future` to complete to get the `String`.

You can use a `FutureBuilder` to handle this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        FutureBuilder(
          future: _getUserLocation(),
          builder: (ctx, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            }
            if (snapshot.error != null) {
              // Handle error...
              return Center(child: Text('An error occurred!'));
            }
            return Container(
              height:170, 
              width: double.infinity,
              child: Image.network(snapshot.data)
            );
          },
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
