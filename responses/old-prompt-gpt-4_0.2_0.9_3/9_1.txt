In Flutter, there's no direct way to customize the `BottomNavigationBar` height. The height of the `BottomNavigationBar` is defined by the Material Design specifications and Flutter adheres to these specifications.

However, you can create a custom widget that mimics the behavior of a `BottomNavigationBar` and allows you to customize the height. Here's a simple example:

```dart
class CustomNavigationBar extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 50.0, // Set this to the height you want.
      child: Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
        children: <Widget>[
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle your button tap here
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle your button tap here
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.person),
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle your button tap here
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

You can use this `CustomNavigationBar` widget in place of the `BottomNavigationBar` in your scaffold:

```dart
Scaffold(
  bottomNavigationBar: CustomNavigationBar(),
  // Other properties...
)
```

Remember that this is a very basic example. You might want to add more functionality to this custom navigation bar to mimic the behavior of the `BottomNavigationBar` more closely.
