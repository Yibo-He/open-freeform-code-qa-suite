This error is caused by a bug in Android Gradle Plugin 4.0.0. The bug is related to the way the plugin handles the signing configuration for the app bundle. 

Here is a workaround for this issue:

1. Open your `build.gradle` (Project: Your_Project_Name) file.

2. Change the `classpath` for the Gradle plugin to downgrade it to version 3.6.3:

```groovy
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.6.3'
    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
    // in the individual module build.gradle files
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle files.

4. Try to generate the signed bundle again.

This should resolve the issue. You can also wait for a new version of the Android Gradle Plugin that fixes this bug.
