The error message you're seeing is indicating that the linker is unable to find the libraries it needs. Here are a few more things you can try:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure all the libraries that you're using are included in your Podfile and that you're using the correct versions. 

2. **Check your project's Library Search Paths**: Go to your project's settings, select your target, go to Build Settings, and look for "Library Search Paths". Make sure that the paths listed here are correct and that they include the locations of your libraries.

3. **Reinstall CocoaPods**: Sometimes, problems can be caused by a corrupted CocoaPods installation. Uninstalling and reinstalling CocoaPods might help.

```bash
sudo gem uninstall cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

4. **Recreate the Xcode project**: If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider recreating your Xcode project. This is a last resort, but it can sometimes resolve issues that are caused by corrupted project files.

5. **Check your Xcode version**: Make sure your Xcode version is compatible with the libraries you're using. Sometimes, libraries are updated to use features that are only available in newer versions of Xcode, so you might need to update Xcode to resolve the issue.

Remember to always backup your project before making any major changes.
