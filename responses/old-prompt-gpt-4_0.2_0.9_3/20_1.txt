I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating experience, especially when you're new to a tool. The orange box you mentioned might have been a connectivity issue with the Jupyter server. The terms you mentioned (`POS`, `POST`, `POSIT`) could be related to HTTP POST requests, which are used to send data to a server. If there was an issue with these, it might have prevented your notebook from saving.

Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is blank and you don't have any other backups, there might not be a way to recover your work. Jupyter Notebooks autosave every few minutes, but if there was a connectivity issue, the autosave might not have worked.

Here are a few suggestions to prevent this from happening in the future:

1. **Regularly save your work**: It seems like you were doing this, but it's worth mentioning. Regularly click `File` > `Save and Checkpoint`.

2. **Create manual checkpoints**: You can create a checkpoint by clicking `File` > `Save and Checkpoint`. This allows you to revert to this checkpoint if needed.

3. **Use version control**: Tools like Git can help you keep track of changes to your files and revert to previous versions if needed.

4. **Backup your work**: Consider using a cloud storage service to backup your work. Some services can automatically backup files in certain directories.

5. **Check for connectivity issues**: If you see an orange box or other error messages in the future, try to resolve them as soon as possible. They might be indicating a problem that could prevent your work from saving.
