Sure, here is a way to convert a `matplotlib` figure to a `PIL` image without saving it to disk:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
import io

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    # Convert plt.Figure to PIL.Image
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

This function works by saving the figure to a `BytesIO` object in memory (not to disk), then opening that object as an image. The `buf.seek(0)` is necessary to reset the position of the `BytesIO` object to the beginning after saving the figure.
