The error `EMFILE: too many open files, watch` means that the system ran out of file descriptors. This is a common issue on systems with small limits on the number of files a process can open simultaneously.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Increase the limit of open files in your system**

   For Unix-based systems, you can temporarily increase the limit of open files with the `ulimit` command:

   ```bash
   ulimit -n 4096
   ```

   This command will increase the limit to 4096. You may need to adjust the number based on your system and needs.

   For permanent changes, you may need to edit system configuration files, which can vary based on your specific OS and version.

2. **Use watchman**

   [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) is a tool by Facebook for watching file changes. It's more efficient and can handle more files than Node's built-in `fs.watch`.

   To install watchman, you can use Homebrew if you're on a Mac:

   ```bash
   brew install watchman
   ```

   If you're on a Linux or Windows, please follow the installation instructions on the [official Watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

3. **Exclude unnecessary directories**

   If your project is large, the file watcher might be watching too many files. You can exclude unnecessary directories (like `node_modules`) from being watched.

   If you're using `watchman`, create a file named `.watchmanconfig` in your project root with the following
