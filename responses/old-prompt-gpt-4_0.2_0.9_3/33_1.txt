The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the Flutter project configuration. It seems like the Flutter project is trying to use a plugin that is not properly configured for Android. 

To fix this, you need to add the following lines to your `settings.gradle` file:

```gradle
include ':app'
include ':location_web'
```

The second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to convert a Future to a String, which is not possible. The `_getUserLocation()` method is asynchronous and returns a Future, not a String. 

You need to wait for the Future to complete before you can use the String. You can do this by using a FutureBuilder:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              FutureBuilder<String>(
                future: _getUserLocation(),
                builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
                  if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                    return CircularProgressIndicator();
                  } else {
                    if (snapshot.hasError)
                      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
                    else
                      return Container(
                        height:170, 
                        width: double.infinity,
                        child: Image.network(snapshot.data)
                      );
                  }
                },
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
  }
}
```

In this code, the FutureBuilder widget takes a Future and a callback function. The
