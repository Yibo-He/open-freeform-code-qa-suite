The problem is that you're trying to destructure `booksRefresh` directly from the parameters of the `AddBookForm` function. But in React, props are passed as an object. So, you should destructure `booksRefresh` from props like this:

```jsx
const AddBookForm = ({booksRefresh}) => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const [description, setDescription] = useState();
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const postRequestHandler = () => {
        addBook(title, description);
        booksRefresh();
    }
...
 return (
        ...
            <Button type="submit" onClick={postRequestHandler} variant="outline-success">Add</Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This way, `booksRefresh` will be correctly extracted from the props object and the error should be resolved.
