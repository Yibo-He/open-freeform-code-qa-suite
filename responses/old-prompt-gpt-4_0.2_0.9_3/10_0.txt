Yes, there is a way to do this in Flutter using the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class. This method will delete all the data stored in the shared preferences.

Here is a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void logoutUser() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In the above code, `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` is used to get an instance of `SharedPreferences` and `prefs.clear()` is used to delete all the data stored in the shared preferences. 

Remember to use `await` keyword before `prefs.clear()` because it returns a `Future` that completes when the operation is finished. 

You can call `logoutUser()` function when the logout button is pressed.
