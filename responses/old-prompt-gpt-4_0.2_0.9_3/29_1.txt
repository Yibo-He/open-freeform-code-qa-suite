Sure, here is the completed Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
  x = np.random.randn(100000)
  
  # Create the histogram using matplotlib, bins must be integer
  plt.hist(x, bins=20, edgecolor='black')

  # Show the plot
  plt.show()

  # Save the figure
  plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

# Call the function
draw_histogram()
```

Please note that the `plt.show()` function will open a window with your histogram. If you don't want this window to appear, you can comment out or remove this line. The `plt.savefig('figure.pdf')` function will save the figure as a PDF file in your current working directory.
