I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating experience that many of us have been through. 

The error message you mentioned might be related to a `POST` request, which is a method used to send data to a server. In the context of Jupyter Notebook, it's used to save your work. If there was an error with the `POST` request, it might have prevented your work from being saved.

Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is blank and there's no other version of the file, it might not be possible to recover your work. Jupyter Notebook doesn't have a built-in version control system, so it doesn't keep a history of changes beyond the most recent checkpoint.

However, here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the .ipynb file again:** Sometimes, the notebook might appear blank when you first open it, but the content could still be there. Try opening the file in a text editor to see if there's any content. Jupyter notebooks are just JSON files, so you should be able to see your code and output in a text editor.

2. **Check for a .ipynb~ file:** Some text editors create a backup file every time you save. If you're lucky, there might be a `filename.ipynb~` file in the same directory as your notebook. This file might contain a more recent version of your work.

3. **Check your Jupyter server logs:** If your Jupyter server is still running, it might have logs of your work. You can check the logs by looking at the terminal window where you started the
