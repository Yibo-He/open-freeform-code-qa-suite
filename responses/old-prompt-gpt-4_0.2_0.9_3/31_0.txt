Yes, you can use a personal access token to clone, commit, and push to your GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
cd /tmp

# Clone the repository
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd <project_name>

# Make changes to your files

# Stage the changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the changes
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Please replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and your project name respectively.

However, it's not recommended to use your personal access token in this way because it's visible in your command line history. A safer way is to use the `git remote` command to add your GitHub repository as a remote with the personal access token, and then push to that remote.

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
cd /tmp

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd <project_name>

# Add remote with personal access token
git remote add origin https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git

# Make changes to your files

# Stage the changes
