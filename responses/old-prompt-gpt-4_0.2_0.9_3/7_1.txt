Sure, the error you're getting is because you're trying to copy a file to a directory without specifying a filename in the destination. You need to join the destination directory with the filename from the source path. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from shutil import copyfile
import os

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        # Get the base filename
        base_filename = os.path.basename(item[0])
        # Create a full path for the destination file
        dest_file = os.path.join(destFolder, base_filename)
        # Copy the file
        copyfile(item[0], dest_file)
```

This function will copy each file in `fileList` to the `destFolder`, preserving the original filenames. Please make sure that `destFolder` exists before running this function.
