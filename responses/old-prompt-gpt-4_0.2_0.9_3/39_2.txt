It seems like you've tried a lot of solutions already. Here are a few more things you could try:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that the libraries you're trying to link are actually included in your Podfile. If they're not, you need to add them and run `pod install` again.

2. **Check your library versions**: Make sure the versions of the libraries you're using are compatible with your version of Xcode and iOS. You might need to update your libraries or downgrade your Xcode/iOS version.

3. **Check your project's Library Search Paths**: Go to your project's settings, then Build Settings, and look for "Library Search Paths". Make sure the paths listed there actually exist and contain the libraries you're trying to link.

4. **Recreate the Xcode project**: If all else fails, you could try creating a new Xcode project and moving your source files over. This can sometimes fix issues that are caused by corrupted project files.

5. **Reinstall CocoaPods**: Sometimes, the issue can be with CocoaPods itself. Uninstalling and reinstalling CocoaPods might help.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
sudo gem uninstall cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then, in your project directory:

```bash
pod deintegrate
pod install
```

Remember to open the `.xcworkspace` file, not the `.xcodeproj` file, after running `pod install`.

6. **Check your system's file permissions**: Make sure your user account has read/write access to the directories where your libraries
