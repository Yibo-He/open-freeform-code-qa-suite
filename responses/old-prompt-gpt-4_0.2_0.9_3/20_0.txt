I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. The error message you mentioned might be related to a `POST` request, which is a method used to send data to a server. In the context of Jupyter Notebook, it might be related to the communication between your notebook and the server. If the server is not able to receive the `POST` request, it might not be able to save your work.

Here are a few things you can try to recover your work:

1. **Check the browser's local storage:** Jupyter Notebook uses the browser's local storage to save your work temporarily. If you haven't cleared your browser cache or local storage, there's a chance your work might still be there. You can check this by opening your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` on MacOS), then go to the `Application` or `Storage` tab, and look for `Local Storage` in the left sidebar. Click on it, and you should see a list of keys and values. Look for keys that start with the path to your notebook. The content of your notebook should be in the value of that key.

2. **Check the terminal output:** If you started Jupyter Notebook from a terminal, there might be some output related to the saving of your notebook. This is a long shot, but it might give you some clues about what happened.

3. **Check the `.ipynb_checkpoints` directory again:** You mentioned that the checkpoint file is blank, but it might be worth checking again. Make sure you're looking at the correct file and directory.
