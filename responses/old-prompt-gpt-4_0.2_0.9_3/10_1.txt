Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class in Flutter. 

Here is a simple example of how you can do this:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void logoutUser() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In this example, `logoutUser` is the function that gets called when the user taps on logout. This function first gets an instance of `SharedPreferences` and then calls the `clear()` method on it, which deletes all the data in shared preferences. 

Please note that `clear()` is an asynchronous function, so you need to use `await` to make sure it completes before proceeding.
