The issue here is that the conda environment is not properly set up in Google Colab. Here is the corrected code:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!conda install -q -y --prefix /usr/local python=3.6 ujson

import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')

import ujson
```

This code does the following:

1. Downloads the latest Miniconda3 installer.
2. Makes the installer executable.
3. Runs the installer in batch mode (`-b`) and forces installation (`-f`) into the directory `/usr/local`.
4. Installs Python 3.6 and the `ujson` package into the conda environment.
5. Appends the path to the conda environment's site-packages directory to the system path.
6. Imports the `ujson` module.

Please note that the `os.environ` lines are not necessary in this case, as the conda environment is set up to use Python 3.6 and the necessary packages are installed into this environment.
