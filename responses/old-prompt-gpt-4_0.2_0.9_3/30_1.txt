This error is usually caused by a misconfiguration in the signing configuration of your Android project. The error message `'other' has different root` suggests that the signing key file (usually a `.jks` or `.keystore` file) is not found at the specified location in your `build.gradle` file.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check the path of your keystore file: Open your `build.gradle` file and look for the `signingConfigs` block. Check the `storeFile` property and make sure it points to the correct location of your keystore file.

```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('path/to/your/keystore/file')
            // other properties...
        }
    }
    // other configurations...
}
```

2. Use an absolute path: If you're using a relative path for the `storeFile` property, try changing it to an absolute path. This can help you ensure that the path is correct.

3. Check the keystore file: Make sure that the keystore file exists at the specified location. If the file is missing, you need to generate a new one or find the original one.

4. Clean and rebuild the project: Sometimes, cleaning and rebuilding the project can solve the issue. You can do this by clicking on `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project` in Android Studio.

If none of these steps solve the issue, please provide more details about your `build.gradle` configuration and the exact error message you're seeing.
