Sure, the error you're getting is because you're trying to copy a file to a directory without specifying a filename in the destination. You should append the filename from the source to the destination directory. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from shutil import copyfile
import os

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        # Get the base name of the source file
        base_name = os.path.basename(item[0])
        # Create a full path for the destination file
        dest_file = os.path.join(destFolder, base_name)
        # Copy the file
        copyfile(item[0], dest_file)
```

This function will copy each file from `fileList` to the `destFolder`, preserving the original filenames. It uses `os.path.basename` to get the filename from the source path, and `os.path.join` to create a full path for the destination file.
