To deploy your Nuxt.js application as a single page application (SPA) to a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by updating your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to generate your static site. You can do this by running the `generate` command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This will create a `dist` directory with your generated application.

3. After that, you need to deploy the `dist` directory to your GitHub Pages repository. You can do this manually by copying the files to your repository, or you can use a tool like `gh-pages` to automate the process.

First, install `gh-pages`:

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

Then, add a `deploy` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

Finally, you can run your `deploy` script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push your `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, which will then be served by GitHub Pages.

Remember to replace the base URL in your `nuxt.config.js` file with your GitHub Pages URL:

```javascript
export default {
  router: {
    base: '/<repository-name>/'
  }
}
```

Replace `<repository-name>` with the name
