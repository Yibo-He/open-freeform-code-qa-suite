The error message `EMFILE: too many open files, watch` is indicating that the system has reached its limit for the number of files it can monitor. This is a common issue when working with large projects in Node.js, especially on systems with low default limits.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

**1. Increase the limit of open files:**

This solution depends on your operating system.

- **For macOS**, you can increase the limit of open files by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
echo kern.maxfiles=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=524288
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=524288
ulimit -n 524288 524288    
```

- **For Linux**, you can increase the limit of open files by editing the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file and adding the following lines:

```bash
* soft nofile 4096
* hard nofile 4096
```

Then, you need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

**2. Use watchman:**

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) is a tool by Facebook for watching file changes. It's more efficient than Node's built-in `fs.watch` and doesn't have the same limit on the number of files. You can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install watchman
```

**3. Exclude unnecessary directories
