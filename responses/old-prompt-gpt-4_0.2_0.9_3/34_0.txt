You can use Angular's `*ngIf` directive to conditionally show or hide the div based on the selected value of the radio group. Here's how you can modify your div:

```html
<div id='divabc' *ngIf="myform.get('Schedule').value === 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

This will show the div with id 'divabc' only when the selected value of the radio group in the form control named 'Schedule' is 'abc'. 

Please note that 'abc' should be the value of the radio button (i.e., `sch_item.ID` should be 'abc' for the corresponding `sch_item.Name`). If 'abc' is the name of the radio button, you should compare it with `sch_item.Name` instead.
