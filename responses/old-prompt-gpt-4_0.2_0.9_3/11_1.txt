In earlier versions of SQL Server, which do not have the `TRIM` function, you can achieve the same result by using a combination of `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions. `LTRIM` removes the leading spaces and `RTRIM` removes the trailing spaces.

Here is how you can implement it:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) as TrimmedString
```

In this code, `LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss))` will first remove the trailing spaces from `@ss` using `RTRIM` and then remove the leading spaces using `LTRIM`. The result is a string without leading or trailing spaces, which is the same as what `TRIM` would do.
