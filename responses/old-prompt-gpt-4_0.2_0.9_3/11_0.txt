In earlier versions of SQL Server that do not support the `TRIM` function, you can achieve the same result using a combination of `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions. `LTRIM` removes leading spaces and `RTRIM` removes trailing spaces. Here's how you can modify your code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) AS TrimmedString
```

In this code, `LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss))` first removes any trailing spaces from `@ss` using `RTRIM`, and then removes any leading spaces using `LTRIM`. The result is a string with no leading or trailing spaces, which is the same as what `TRIM` would return.
