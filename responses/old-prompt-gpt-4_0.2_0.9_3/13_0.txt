In SwiftUI, `List` and `ForEach` are both used to display a collection of data, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors.

**List**

`List` is a container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column. It is similar to `UITableView` in UIKit. `List` is responsible for the UI presentation and it automatically provides scrolling capabilities. It also supports features such as swipe to delete and moving rows.

Here's an example of how to use `List`:

```swift
List {
    Text("Item 1")
    Text("Item 2")
    Text("Item 3")
}
```

**ForEach**

`ForEach` is a structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data. It is not a UI element itself, but a way to generate views from a collection. It is similar to `for-in` loop in Swift.

Here's an example of how to use `ForEach`:

```swift
ForEach(0..<5) { index in
    Text("Item \(index)")
}
```

**Combining List and ForEach**

In many cases, `List` and `ForEach` are used together. `List` provides the container for the rows of data, and `ForEach` is used to generate the rows from a collection of data.

Here's an example of how to use `List` and `ForEach` together:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(0..<5) { index in
        Text("Item \(index)")
    }
}
```

In this example, `List` provides the scrolling list of rows, and `ForEach` generates
