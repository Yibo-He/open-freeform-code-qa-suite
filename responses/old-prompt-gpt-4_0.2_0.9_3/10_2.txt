Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class in Flutter. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add the shared_preferences dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  shared_preferences: ^2.0.6
```

Then, you can use the following code to clear all the shared preferences:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void clearPreferences() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In this code, `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` is used to get an instance of `SharedPreferences`, and `clear()` is used to delete all the data from `SharedPreferences`. This function can be called when the user taps on logout.

Remember to run `flutter pub get` after adding the dependency to fetch the package.
