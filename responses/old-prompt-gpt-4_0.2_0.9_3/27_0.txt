From your `app.module.ts`, it seems like you have correctly imported the `FlexLayoutModule` in your application. However, to use Angular Flex Layout in your `login-view` component, you need to ensure a few things:

1. **Import FlexLayoutModule in the module of your component:** If your `login-view` component is declared in a different module (other than `app.module.ts`), you need to import `FlexLayoutModule` in that module as well.

2. **Use Flex Layout directives in your component's template:** In your `login-view` component's HTML template, you should use Flex Layout directives like `fxLayout`, `fxFlex`, etc. Here is an example:

```html
<div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="center center">
  <div fxFlex="50%">
    <!-- Your login form goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

3. **Check for any console errors:** If you have done the above steps and it's still not working, check your browser's console for any errors. It might give you a clue about what's going wrong.

If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your `login-view` component and the problem you're facing.
