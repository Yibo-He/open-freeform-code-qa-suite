The error message indicates that the MongoDB version you're trying to download doesn't exist for your platform. The MongoDB version is `4.0.14` and the platform is `win32` with `ia32` architecture.

The MongoDB Memory Server tries to download the MongoDB binary automatically, but it seems like the version it's trying to download is not available for your platform.

You can try to fix this issue by specifying a different MongoDB version in your `package.json` file. You can do this by adding the `mongodb-memory-server` package with a specific version like this:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "mongodb-memory-server": "^6.9.6"
}
```

Then, you can specify the MongoDB version in your Jest setup file or in your test file like this:

```javascript
const { MongoMemoryServer } = require('mongodb-memory-server');

const mongod = new MongoMemoryServer({
  binary: {
    version: '4.2.12' // specify the version you want to use
  }
});
```

This will tell MongoDB Memory Server to use the specified version of MongoDB.

If the problem persists, you might want to check if there are any network issues that prevent the MongoDB binary from being downloaded. You can also try to download the MongoDB binary manually and then specify the path to the binary in your code.
