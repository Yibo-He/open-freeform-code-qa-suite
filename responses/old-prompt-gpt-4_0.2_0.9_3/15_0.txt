Sure, you can use `io.BytesIO` to create a file-like object in memory, then save your figure to this object using `fig.savefig()`. After that, you can use `PIL.Image.open()` to convert this object to a PIL image. Here is the completed code:

```python
import io
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

This function will take a `matplotlib` figure as input and return a `PIL` image. The figure is saved to a `BytesIO` object in memory as a PNG image, which is then opened as a `PIL` image.
