The error message `EMFILE: too many open files, watch` suggests that the system has reached its limit for the number of files it can monitor. This is a common issue when working with large projects in Node.js, especially on systems with low default limits.

Here are some ways to fix this issue:

**1. Increase the limit of open files**

You can increase the limit of open files in your system. The way to do this depends on your operating system.

- On Linux, you can use the `ulimit` command:

    ```bash
    ulimit -n 4096
    ```

- On macOS, you can create or modify a file at `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add the following line:

    ```bash
    kern.maxfiles=20480
    kern.maxfilesperproc=18000
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```

**2. Use watchman**

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) is a tool by Facebook for watching file changes. It's more efficient than the default Node.js file watcher. To install it:

- On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install watchman
    ```

- On Linux, you can build from source. See the [installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

After installing watchman, your project should automatically start using it.

**3. Ignore unnecessary files**

You can configure your file watcher to ignore unnecessary files (like `node_modules`). This reduces the number of
