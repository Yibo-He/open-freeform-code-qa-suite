The error message suggests that the application is trying to use Ribbon for client-side load balancing, but the required dependencies are not found. Ribbon is a client-side load balancer that works well with Spring Cloud and service discovery tools like Eureka.

Although you mentioned that you have added the Ribbon dependency and it didn't help, please ensure that you have added the correct dependency. Here is the correct Ribbon dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If you have already added this dependency and still facing the issue, then there might be a problem with the Ribbon configuration or it might be a compatibility issue.

Since you are using Spring Boot 2.0.8, you should use the Spring Cloud version compatible with it. For Spring Boot 2.0.x, the compatible Spring Cloud version is Finchley.

Also, ensure that you have `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation in your main application class to enable service discovery which is required for Ribbon to work.

If you don't want to use Ribbon and want to disable it, you can do so by setting the following property in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
feign.ribbon.enabled=false
```

This will disable Ribbon and the application will no longer try to use Ribbon for load balancing.
