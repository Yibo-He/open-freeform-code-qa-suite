From your `app.module.ts`, it seems like you have imported the `FlexLayoutModule` correctly. However, to use it in your `login-view` component, you need to make sure that you have also imported it in the module where your `login-view` component is declared.

If your `login-view` component is declared in `AuthModule`, then you should import `FlexLayoutModule` in `auth.module.ts` like this:

```typescript
import { FlexLayoutModule } from '@angular/flex-layout';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // your components here
  ],
  imports: [
    // other modules here
    FlexLayoutModule
  ]
})
export class AuthModule { }
```

Also, make sure you are using the correct directives from `FlexLayoutModule` in your `login-view` component's template. Here is an example of how you can use it:

```html
<div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="center center">
  <!-- your content here -->
</div>
```

In this example, `fxLayout="row"` sets the layout direction to row, and `fxLayoutAlign="center center"` aligns the layout's items in the center both horizontally and vertically.
