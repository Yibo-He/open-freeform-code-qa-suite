Yes, you can use a personal access token to clone, commit, and push to a GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clone the repository**

    First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and the name of your project respectively.

    ```bash
    git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

    Change your current directory to the cloned repository.

    ```bash
    cd <project_name>
    ```

3. **Make changes and commit**

    Make changes to your project files as needed. Once you're ready to commit, use the `git add` command to stage your changes, and `git commit` to commit them. 

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

4. **Push your changes**

    Finally, push your changes to the repository. Again, replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and the name of your project respectively.

    ```bash
    git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
    ```

    Note: If you're working on a specific branch, don't forget to specify it in the `git push` command:

    ```bash
    git push https://<
