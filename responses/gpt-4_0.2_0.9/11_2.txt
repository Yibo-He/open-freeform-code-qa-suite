In earlier versions of SQL Server that do not support the TRIM function, you can use a combination of LTRIM and RTRIM functions to achieve the same result. The LTRIM function removes leading spaces from a string, and the RTRIM function removes trailing spaces. Here's how you can modify your code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) AS TrimmedString
```

In this code, the LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) part first applies the RTRIM function to remove any trailing spaces from @ss, and then applies the LTRIM function to remove any leading spaces from the result. The final result is a string with no leading or trailing spaces, which is equivalent to what the TRIM function would do.
