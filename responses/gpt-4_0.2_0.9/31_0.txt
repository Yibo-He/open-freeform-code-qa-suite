Yes, you can use a personal access token to clone, commit, and push to your GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   You can clone the repository using your personal access token like this:

   ```
   git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<repository_name>.git
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username, `<personal_access_token>` with your personal access token, and `<repository_name>` with the name of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   After cloning the repository, navigate to the repository directory:

   ```
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

3. **Make changes and commit:**
   You can now make changes to your repository. After making changes, you can commit them using the `git commit` command:

   ```
   git commit -a -m 'Your commit message'
   ```

   The `-a` option tells Git to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not affected. Replace `'Your commit message'` with a brief description of the changes you made.

4. **Push changes:**
   Finally, you can push your changes to GitHub using your personal access token:

   ```
   git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<repository_name>.git
   ```

   Again, replace `<username>` with your GitHub username, `<personal_access_token>` with your personal access token, and `<repository_name>` with the name of your repository.
