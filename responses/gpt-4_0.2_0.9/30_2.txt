This error is usually caused by a misconfiguration in the signing configuration of your Android project. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Check your `build.gradle` file: Make sure that the `signingConfigs` block in your `build.gradle` file is correctly configured. The `storeFile` property should point to the correct location of your keystore file.

2. Check the path of your keystore file: The path to your keystore file should be absolute, not relative. If you're using a relative path, try changing it to an absolute path.

3. Check the keystore file: Make sure that the keystore file you're using is valid and not corrupted. If you're not sure, try creating a new keystore file and use that instead.

4. Clean and rebuild your project: Sometimes, simply cleaning and rebuilding your project can solve the issue. You can do this by going to `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project`.

5. Invalidate caches and restart: If none of the above solutions work, try invalidating the caches and restarting Android Studio. You can do this by going to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart`.

If you're still facing the issue after trying these solutions, please provide more details about your configuration and the exact error message you're getting.
