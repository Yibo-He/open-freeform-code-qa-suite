Sure, you can use `io.BytesIO` to save the figure to memory, then open that as an image. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
import io

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

This function works by creating a `BytesIO` object, which is like a file that lives in memory instead of on disk. It then saves the figure to that "file", seeks back to the beginning of the "file", and opens that "file" as an image.
