To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to GitHub pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by setting the `mode` property in your `nuxt.config.js` file to `'spa'`.

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to install `push-dir` package which will help you to push your `dist` folder to gh-pages branch. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install push-dir --save-dev
```

4. Add a `deploy` script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup"
}
```

5. Now, you can deploy your application to GitHub pages by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push your `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, which GitHub Pages can then use to host your application.

Remember to replace all local URLs with absolute URLs since you are deploying to a sub-path and not the root of the domain. You can use the `router.base` option in `nuxt.config.js` for this.

```javascript
export default {
  router: {
    base: '/
