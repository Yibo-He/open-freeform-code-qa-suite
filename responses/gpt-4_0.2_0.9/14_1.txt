To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by adding `mode: 'spa'` to your `nuxt.config.js` file.

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to install `push-dir` package which will help you to push your `dist` directory to gh-pages branch. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install push-dir --save-dev
```

4. Add a `deploy` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup"
}
```

5. Now, you can deploy your application to GitHub Pages by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push your `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, which GitHub Pages can then use to host your website.

Remember to commit all your changes before running the deploy command. Also, make sure that your repository is correctly set up for GitHub Pages. You might need to go into your repository settings on GitHub and set the GitHub Pages source to the `gh-pages` branch.
