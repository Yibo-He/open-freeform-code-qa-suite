Yes, you can see the result graphs directly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) itself. You need to install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code and use the built-in Jupyter notebook interface. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code from the marketplace.

2. Once you have the Python extension installed, open a new file and change the file type to "Jupyter" by clicking on the language indicator at the bottom right (it probably says "Python") and then selecting "Jupyter".

3. Now you can write your code in cells. To create a cell, type `#%%` and then press enter. This will create a new cell where you can write your code.

4. Paste your code into the cell and then click the "Run Cell" button that appears in the top right of the cell. This will run the code and display the output directly below the cell.

Here's how your code would look:

```python
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Remember to save the file with a `.ipynb` extension.

Note: You mentioned that you don't want to install Jupyter notebooks. However, the Python extension for VS Code uses Jupyter under the hood to provide this functionality. You don't need to manually install Jupyter, as the Python extension will handle this for you.
