Sure, here is a simple function in JavaScript that converts a local Date object to a UTC Date object:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
    var utcDate = new Date(date.getUTCFullYear(), date.getUTCMonth(), date.getUTCDate(), date.getUTCHours(), date.getUTCMinutes(), date.getUTCSeconds());
    return utcDate;
}
```

This function creates a new Date object using the UTC year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds of the input date. Please note that JavaScript Date object is based on the UTC time by default, but when you display a date, it is automatically converted to the local time of the computer. This function will return a Date object that represents the same moment in time as the input, but with all the components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) in UTC.
