The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is because the location package you are using is trying to find its web implementation, but it's not found. If you are not developing for web, you can ignore this warning.

The error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to convert a Future to a String directly. The `_getUserLocation()` function is asynchronous and returns a Future. You need to wait for the Future to complete to get the actual value.

You can use a FutureBuilder to handle this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  //LocationHelper.mapviewpointer(latitude: )
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height:170, 
                width: double.infinity,
                child: FutureBuilder(
                  future: _getUserLocation(),
                  builder: (ctx, snapshot) {
                    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                      return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
                    }
                    if (snapshot.error != null) {
                      // Handle error...
                      return Center(child: Text('An error occurred!'));
                    }
                    return Image.network(snapshot.data);
                  },
                ),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
  }
}
```

In this code, while the Future is not yet complete, a loading spinner is shown. Once the Future completes, the image is loaded from the network. If an error occurs while trying to fetch the location,
