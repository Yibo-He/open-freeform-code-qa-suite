Sure, here is a simple function that converts a local Date object to a UTC Date object in JavaScript:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
    // Get the local time zone offset in minutes
    var timezoneOffset = date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000;
    
    // Convert the local date to UTC by subtracting the time zone offset
    var utcDate = new Date(date.getTime() - timezoneOffset);
    
    return utcDate;
}
```

This function works by first getting the time zone offset in minutes from the input date. It then subtracts this offset from the date's time value (which is in milliseconds since the Unix epoch) to get the UTC time. Finally, it creates a new Date object from this UTC time and returns it.

Please note that the returned Date object is still a JavaScript Date object, which means that if you print it directly, it will be displayed in the local time zone of the machine where the code is running. If you want to display the date in UTC, you can use the `toUTCString()` method of the Date object.
