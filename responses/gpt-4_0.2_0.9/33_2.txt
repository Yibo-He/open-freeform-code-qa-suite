The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the Flutter location package. This error usually occurs when the package is not properly installed or configured. 

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Go to your `pubspec.yaml` file and make sure you have the latest version of the location package. You can check the latest version on the [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/location) website.

2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

3. If the error still persists, try to clean the project by running `flutter clean` and then run the app again.

Regarding the second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems like you are trying to convert a Future object to a String. The `Image.network()` function expects a String URL, but you are providing a Future.

You can use a FutureBuilder to wait for the Future to complete and then display the image. Here is how you can do it:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              } else {
                if (snapshot.hasError)
                  return
