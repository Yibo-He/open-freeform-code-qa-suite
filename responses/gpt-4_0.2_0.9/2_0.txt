Yes, you can see the result graphs in Visual Studio Code itself directly by using the built-in Python Interactive Window. This feature is provided by the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.

Here are the steps:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code if you haven't done so already. You can do this by clicking on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`, and then searching for 'Python'.

2. Once the Python extension is installed, you can open the Python Interactive Window by clicking on the Python icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or by using the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and typing 'Python: Create Python Interactive Window'.

3. In the Python Interactive Window, you can run your code. The plots will be displayed directly in the window.

Here is your code that you can run in the Python Interactive Window:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Remember, you need to select the code and press `Shift+Enter` to run the code in the Python Interactive Window.

Note: The Python Interactive Window is similar to Jupyter Notebooks, but it doesn't require you to install Jupyter Notebooks. It's a feature of the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.
