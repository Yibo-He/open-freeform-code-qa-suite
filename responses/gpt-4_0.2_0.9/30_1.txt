This error is usually caused by a mismatch between the Gradle version and the Android Gradle plugin version. 

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin**: Make sure both are updated to the latest version. You can do this by going to `File > Project Structure > Project` in Android Studio. As of now, the latest Gradle version is 7.2 and the latest Android Gradle plugin version is 7.0.2.

2. **Check your JDK version**: Android Studio 4.0 and higher requires JDK 8 or higher. You can download it from the Oracle website and then set it in your project structure dialog.

3. **Clean and Rebuild your project**: Sometimes, simply cleaning and rebuilding your project can solve the issue. You can do this by going to `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project`.

4. **Invalidate Caches / Restart**: This option is available under the `File` menu in Android Studio. It clears the local cache of the IDE and forces it to resync with the project files.

5. **Check your keystore path**: Make sure the path to your keystore file is correct and it exists. If you are using a relative path, try changing it to an absolute path.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider downgrading your Android Studio and Gradle versions to the ones you were using before the update.
