Your `app.module.ts` seems to be correctly importing the `FlexLayoutModule`. If you're having trouble getting `FlexLayout` to work in your `login-view` component, there are a few things you should check:

1. **Check your `login-view` component's module**: If your `login-view` component is declared in a different module (not the `AppModule`), you need to import the `FlexLayoutModule` in that module as well.

2. **Check your usage in the `login-view` component**: Make sure you are using the correct syntax for `FlexLayout`. Here is an example of how to use it in your HTML:

```html
<div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="center center">
  <div fxFlex="50%">
    <!-- Your content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

3. **Check your styles**: `FlexLayout` applies styles directly to the elements, so if you have conflicting styles in your CSS, it might prevent `FlexLayout` from working correctly.

4. **Check for errors**: Look at the console in your browser's developer tools. If there are any errors related to `FlexLayout`, they should appear there.

5. **Check your version of Angular**: `FlexLayout` requires Angular 4.4.4 or higher. If you're using an older version of Angular, you might need to upgrade.

If you've checked all of these and you're still having problems, please provide more details about what exactly isn't working, and I'll be glad to help further.
