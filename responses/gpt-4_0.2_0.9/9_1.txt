In Flutter, the `BottomNavigationBar` widget doesn't have a direct property to change its height. However, there are a few workarounds you can use to achieve this:

1. **Using a `Transform` widget**: You can wrap your `BottomNavigationBar` in a `Transform` widget and scale it down to reduce its height. However, this will also scale down the size of the icons and text.

```dart
Transform(
  transform: Matrix4.identity()..scale(1.0, 0.8), // you can adjust the scale as needed
  child: BottomNavigationBar(
    // your BottomNavigationBar code here
  ),
)
```

2. **Creating a custom `BottomNavigationBar`**: If you want more control over the appearance and size of your `BottomNavigationBar`, you can create a custom widget. This will allow you to specify the exact height you want.

```dart
Container(
  height: 50, // specify the height you want
  child: BottomAppBar(
    child: Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        // your custom navigation bar items here
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
```

Remember that if you choose to create a custom `BottomNavigationBar`, you will also need to handle the functionality for switching between tabs yourself.

3. **Using a third-party package**: There are several third-party packages available that allow you to create a custom `BottomNavigationBar` with a specified height, such as `convex_bottom_bar`. You can find these packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).
