The error message indicates that the MongoDB version you're trying to download doesn't exist for your platform. The MongoDB version being downloaded is 4.0.14 for the win32 platform with the ia32 architecture.

You can try to fix this issue by specifying a different MongoDB version in your package.json file. Here's how you can do it:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "version": "4.2.6"
  }
}
```

This will download MongoDB version 4.2.6 instead of 4.0.14. You can replace "4.2.6" with any other version that you know is compatible with your platform.

If you're still having issues, you can try to download the MongoDB binary manually and then specify the path to the binary in your package.json file:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "downloadDir": "/path/to/your/downloaded/binary"
  }
}
```

Replace "/path/to/your/downloaded/binary" with the actual path to your downloaded MongoDB binary.

Remember to run `npm install` after modifying your package.json file to apply the changes.
