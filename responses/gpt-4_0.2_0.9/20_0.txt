I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating situation to be in. Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is blank and you don't have any other backups, it might be difficult to recover your work. 

The orange box you mentioned might have been a notification about a failed autosave. The terms you mentioned (`POS`, `POST`, `POSIT`) might be related to HTTP POST, which is a request method supported by HTTP used by the browser to send data to the server. In the context of Jupyter, it might be used to send your notebook data to the server for saving. If there was an error with this, it might explain why your work wasn't saved.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the browser's local storage:** Jupyter uses the browser's local storage to store unsaved changes. If you haven't cleared your browser cache or local storage, there might be a chance that your changes are still there. You can check this by opening the developer tools in your browser (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "Inspect"), then going to the "Application" tab and looking for Local Storage in the left sidebar. If you see any entries related to your notebook, you might be able to recover some data.

2. **Check the terminal output:** If you started Jupyter from a terminal, there might be some error messages or other useful information in the terminal output.

3. **Check the Jupyter server logs:** If you're running Jupyter as a service, you might be able to find some information in the server logs.
