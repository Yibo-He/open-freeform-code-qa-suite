To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to GitHub pages, you will need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by updating your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to install `push-dir` package which will help you to push your `dist` folder to gh-pages branch. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev push-dir
```

4. Then, add a `deploy` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup"
}
```

5. Now, you can deploy your application to GitHub pages by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build your application and push the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

Remember to replace the base URL in your `nuxt.config.js` file with your GitHub pages URL:

```javascript
export default {
  router: {
    base: '/your-repo-name/'
  }
}
```

Also, don't forget to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings and set the source as the `gh-pages` branch.
