Yes, you can display the plot within Visual Studio Code itself by using the built-in Python Interactive Window. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure you have the Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code. You can install it from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).

2. Then, you can use the `#%%` comment to separate your code into cells. The Python Interactive Window will execute each cell separately and display the results in the Interactive Window.

3. To run a cell, you can click on the `Run Cell` button that appears above the cell or use the `Shift+Enter` shortcut.

Here's your code modified to use cells:

```python
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

#%%
x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Each `#%%` indicates a new cell. When you run the second cell, the plot will be displayed in the Python Interactive Window within Visual Studio Code.

Remember to save your file with a `.py` extension and select a Python interpreter before running the cells. You can select an interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the status bar.
