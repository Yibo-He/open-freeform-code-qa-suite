The error message suggests that you are missing the Ribbon dependency in your project. Ribbon is a client-side load balancer that works with Spring Cloud and service discovery. Even though you mentioned that you have added the Ribbon dependency, it didn't help. It might be due to the version mismatch or some other configuration issue.

Here is the Ribbon dependency that you should add to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If adding the Ribbon dependency doesn't solve the problem, you can try to exclude Ribbon from the Feign dependency and see if that works:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to check if there are any other dependencies in your project that could be causing conflicts. Also, make sure that you have the correct Spring Cloud version that is compatible with your Spring Boot version. You can check the Spring Cloud Release train table to find out the compatible versions: https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview

Lastly, ensure that your `@FeignClient` is properly scanned by `@EnableFeignClients`. If your main class and Feign client
