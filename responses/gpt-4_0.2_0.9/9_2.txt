In Flutter, the `BottomNavigationBar` widget does not have a property to directly change its height. However, there are a few workarounds to achieve this:

1. **Using a `Transform` widget**: You can wrap the `BottomNavigationBar` in a `Transform` widget and scale it down to reduce its height.

```dart
Transform(
  transform: Matrix4.identity()..scale(1.0, 0.7), // adjust the second parameter to control the height
  child: BottomNavigationBar(
    // your code here
  ),
)
```

2. **Creating a custom `BottomNavigationBar`**: You can create your own custom `BottomNavigationBar` with a `Container` and `Row` or `Column` widgets. This way, you have full control over the height and other properties.

```dart
Container(
  height: 50, // set your desired height
  child: Row(
    children: <Widget>[
      // your custom navigation bar items
    ],
  ),
)
```

Please note that these are workarounds and may not be perfect solutions. The Flutter team designed the `BottomNavigationBar` with certain guidelines in mind, and changing its height may not align with these guidelines.
