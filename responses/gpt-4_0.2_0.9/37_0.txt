Sure, you can get the screen height by subtracting the insets height from the original height. Here is how you can complete your function:

```kotlin
fun getWidthHeight(wm: WindowManager): Int {
    val windowMetrics = wm.currentWindowMetrics
    val windowInsets: WindowInsets = windowMetrics.windowInsets

    val insets = windowInsets.getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(WindowInsets.Type.navigationBars() or WindowInsets.Type.displayCutout())
    val insetsHeight = insets.top + insets.bottom

    val b = windowMetrics.bounds
    val orig_height = b.height()

    // Subtract insets height from original height to get actual screen height
    val screenHeight = orig_height - insetsHeight

    return screenHeight
}
```
This function will return the screen height excluding the space taken by navigation bars and display cutouts.
