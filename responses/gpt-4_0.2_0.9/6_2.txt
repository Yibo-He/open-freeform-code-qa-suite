The error message you're seeing suggests that there's an issue with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which is a protocol used for securing connections between web clients and servers. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check if your application is configured to use SSL:** If your application is configured to use SSL, you need to access it using `https://localhost:8080`. If it's not, you should use `http://localhost:8080`. Check your application's configuration to see if it's set up to use SSL.

2. **Check your SSL configuration:** If your application is indeed set up to use SSL, there might be an issue with your SSL configuration. Check if the SSL certificate is correctly installed and configured.

3. **Try a different browser or clear your browser's cache:** Sometimes, the issue might be with your browser. Try accessing the application in a different browser, or clear your browser's cache and cookies and try again.

4. **Check your firewall and antivirus settings:** Sometimes, firewall or antivirus software can interfere with SSL connections. Check your firewall and antivirus settings to make sure they're not blocking the connection.

5. **Check if the port is being used by another process:** If the port 8080 is being used by another process, your application won't be able to use it. You can check this by running `netstat -ano | findstr :8080` in the command prompt. If the port is being used by another process, you'll need to stop that process or configure your application to use a different port.
