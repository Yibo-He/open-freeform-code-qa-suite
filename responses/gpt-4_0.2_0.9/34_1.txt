You can use Angular's `*ngIf` directive to conditionally show/hide the `div` based on the selected value of the radio group. Here is how you can modify your `div`:

```html
<div id='divabc' *ngIf="myform.get('Schedule').value == 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

This will show the `div` only when the selected radio button's value is "abc". Please replace 'abc' with the actual ID of the radio button that represents "abc".

Please note that this assumes you are using Reactive Forms and `myform` is a `FormGroup` instance. If you are using Template-driven forms, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
