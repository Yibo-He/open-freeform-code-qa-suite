The error you're getting is because the Python interpreter can't find the 'ujson' module in the paths it's searching. This is likely because the paths are not set correctly. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!conda install -q -y --prefix /usr/local python=3.6 ujson

import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')

import ujson
```

This code does the following:

1. Downloads the latest version of Miniconda.
2. Makes the downloaded script executable.
3. Installs Miniconda to the specified path.
4. Installs the 'ujson' package using conda.
5. Appends the path where the 'ujson' package is installed to the list of paths that Python searches when importing modules.
6. Imports the 'ujson' module.

Please note that the Python version installed by Miniconda is specified as 3.6 in the conda install command. If you need a different version, you can change the 'python=3.6' part to the version you need.
