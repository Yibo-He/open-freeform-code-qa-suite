Sure, the error you're seeing is because you're trying to copy a file to a directory without specifying a filename in the destination. You need to include the filename in the destination path. Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
from shutil import copyfile
import os

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        # Get the base name of the source file
        base_name = os.path.basename(item[0])
        # Construct the destination file path
        dest_file = os.path.join(destFolder, base_name)
        # Copy the file
        copyfile(item[0], dest_file)
```

This function will copy each file in `fileList` to `destFolder`, preserving the original filenames. It uses `os.path.basename` to get the filename from the source path, and `os.path.join` to construct the destination path.
