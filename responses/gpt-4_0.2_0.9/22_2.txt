The issue is that you're trying to destructure `booksRefresh` directly from the props, but you're not using the correct syntax. You need to wrap it in curly braces `{}`. Here's the corrected `AddBookForm` component:

```jsx
const AddBookForm = ({booksRefresh}) => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const [description, setDescription] = useState();
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const postRequestHandler = () => {
        addBook(title, description);
        booksRefresh();
    }
...
 return (
        ...
            <Button type="submit" onClick={postRequestHandler} variant="outline-success">Add</Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

In your original code, `booksRefresh` was being treated as the entire props object, not the function passed in as a prop. By adding the curly braces, you're destructuring the `booksRefresh` function from the props.
