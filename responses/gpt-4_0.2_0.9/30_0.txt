This error occurs when the Android Gradle plugin tries to compare two files that are located in different file systems. This is a known issue in Android Studio 4.0 and Gradle 6.1.1.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Downgrade Gradle version**: You can try downgrading your Gradle version to 5.6.4 and see if it resolves the issue. You can do this by changing the Gradle version in your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file.

2. **Move your project to the same drive as Android Studio**: If your project is on a different drive than your Android Studio installation, try moving it to the same drive.

3. **Use command line for generating the signed bundle**: You can try generating the signed bundle using the command line instead of the Android Studio GUI. Here's the command you can use:

```
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

4. **Update Android Studio and Gradle**: This issue has been fixed in later versions of Android Studio and Gradle. Try updating to the latest stable version of both.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes to your development environment.
