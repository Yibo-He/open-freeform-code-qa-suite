The error is because you are trying to destructure `booksRefresh` directly from the props in the child component, but you are not passing it as an object in the parent component. 

Here is the corrected `AddBookForm` component:

```jsx
import React, {useState} from "react";
import {Redirect} from "react-router";
import {addBook} from "../api/api";
import {Button} from "react-bootstrap";

const AddBookForm = ({booksRefresh}) => { // Destructure booksRefresh from props
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const [description, setDescription] = useState();
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const postRequestHandler = () => {
        addBook(title, description);
        booksRefresh();
    }
...
 return (
        ...
            <Button type="submit" onClick={postRequestHandler} variant="outline-success">Add</Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

In your `AddBookForm` component, you were trying to destructure `booksRefresh` from the props, but you were not passing it as an object. You were passing it as a single prop. When you pass it as a single prop, it is equivalent to `props = {booksRefresh: booksRefresh}`. So, you need to destructure it from the props in your child component.
