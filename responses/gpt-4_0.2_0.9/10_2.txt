Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method. This method is used to remove all keys and values from the shared preferences. Here is an example of how you can use it:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void logout() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In this example, when the `logout` function is called, it will clear all data saved in the shared preferences.
