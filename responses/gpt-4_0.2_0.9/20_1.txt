I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating situation to be in. Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is also blank, it's likely that the work is lost. Jupyter Notebook autosaves every few minutes to this checkpoint file, so if it's blank, then it seems like the saving process was not successful.

The error message you saw might have been related to a failed autosave. In Jupyter, "POST" is a type of HTTP request that is used to send data; in this case, it's used to send your notebook data to the server to be saved. If there was an error with this, it could explain why your work was not saved.

In the future, to avoid this kind of situation, you can:

1. Regularly download a copy of your notebook (File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)). This will save a copy of your notebook to your local machine.

2. Use a version control system like Git. This is a more advanced solution, but it allows you to save versions of your work and revert back to them if needed.

3. Make sure your notebook is running without errors. If you see an error message, try to address it right away, as it could affect the saving process.

4. Increase the autosave frequency. By default, Jupyter autosaves every 120 seconds. You can change this in the Jupyter settings if you want it to autosave more frequently.

Unfortunately, without a backup or a successful checkpoint, there's not much that can be done to recover your work. It's a hard lesson to learn, but it's a common experience
