Swagger Codegen is a powerful tool that allows you to generate client libraries automatically from a Swagger spec, which makes it easier to create client apps that consume your APIs. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen:

1. **Install Swagger Codegen**: If you haven't installed Swagger Codegen yet, you can do so by using Homebrew if you're on a Mac:

    ```
    brew install swagger-codegen
    ```

    If you're on Windows, you can download the Swagger Codegen jar file from its GitHub repository.

2. **Get the Swagger Spec File**: You need to have a Swagger spec file (usually a JSON or YAML file) that describes your API. This file is usually auto-generated by your server framework. If you don't have one, you can create one manually or use tools like Swagger Editor.

3. **Generate the Client Code**: Once you have the Swagger spec file, you can generate the client code. Here's the basic command:

    ```
    swagger-codegen generate -i /path/to/swagger/spec -l language -o /path/to/output/directory
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/swagger/spec` with the path to your Swagger spec file, `language` with the language you want to generate the client in (like java, python, ruby, etc.), and `/path/to/output/directory` with the directory where you want the generated code to be saved.

    For example, if you want to generate a Python client and your Swagger spec file is located at `/Users/username/Documents/swagger.json`, you can use the following command:
