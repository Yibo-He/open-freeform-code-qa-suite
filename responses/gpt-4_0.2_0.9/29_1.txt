Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the completed Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
  x = np.random.randn(100000)
  
  # Create a histogram with 20 bins
  plt.hist(x, bins=20, edgecolor='black')

  # Add title and labels
  plt.title('Histogram of Normal Distribution')
  plt.xlabel('Value')
  plt.ylabel('Frequency')

  # Save the figure
  plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

  # Show the plot
  plt.show()

# Call the function
draw_histogram()
```

This code will generate 100,000 random numbers from a normal distribution, create a histogram with 20 bins, and save the figure as 'figure.pdf'. It will also display the histogram.
