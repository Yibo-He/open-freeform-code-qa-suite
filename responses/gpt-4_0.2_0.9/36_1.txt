The error message suggests that the Feign Client is not able to find the load balancing mechanism, which is provided by Ribbon in Spring Cloud. Even though you mentioned that you have added the Ribbon dependency, it seems like it's not being picked up.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Add Ribbon Dependency**: Make sure you have added the Ribbon dependency in your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. **Check Dependency Versions**: Ensure that the versions of your dependencies are compatible with each other. You can check the [Spring Cloud Release Train](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview) for the compatible versions.

3. **Clean and Rebuild**: Sometimes, the issue might be due to the cached dependencies. You can try cleaning and rebuilding your project. If you are using Maven, you can do this by running `mvn clean install`.

4. **Check Configuration**: Make sure that your `@FeignClient` is being scanned and that your main class is in a package that is a parent of all your other packages. If not, you may need to specify the base packages to scan. For example:

    ```java
    @EnableFeignClients(basePackages = {"com.example"})
    ```

5. **Check Ribbon Configuration**: If you are using Ribbon without Eureka, you need to specify the list of servers in your configuration. For example:

    ```yml
    user-service:
