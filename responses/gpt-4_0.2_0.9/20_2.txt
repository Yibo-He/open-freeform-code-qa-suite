I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating experience, especially when you're new to a tool. 

The orange box you mentioned might have been a notification about a failed auto-save operation. The terms you mentioned (`POS`, `POST`, `POSIT`) could be related to `POST` request which is a method used to send data to a server, in this case, to save your notebook. If this operation failed due to some reason (like network issues), your notebook might not have been saved.

Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is blank and there are no other versions in the `.ipynb_checkpoints` directory, it might not be possible to recover your work. Jupyter Notebook doesn't have a built-in recovery feature for such cases.

Here are a few suggestions to avoid such issues in the future:

1. **Regularly Save and Checkpoint**: Make sure to regularly save your work. Although Jupyter Notebook has an autosave feature, it's good practice to manually save your work frequently.

2. **Version Control**: Consider using a version control system like Git. This allows you to save versions of your work, so you can always go back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

3. **Backup**: Regularly backup your notebooks. You can use cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or any other service you prefer.

4. **Check for Errors**: If you see any error or warning messages, don't ignore them. Try to understand what they mean and fix the issue if possible. If you're not sure about an error, you can always look it up online or ask for help.
