The error message `EMFILE: too many open files, watch` suggests that the number of files that the system's kernel is trying to watch exceeds the limit. This is a common issue on systems with a lot of files and limited resources.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Increase the limit of open files in your system**: You can increase the limit of open files in your system. For Unix-based systems, you can use the `ulimit` command. You can check the current limit with `ulimit -n` and increase it with `ulimit -n 4096` or any number you prefer. However, this solution is temporary and the limit will reset after a system reboot.

2. **Use watchman**: Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching file changes. It is more efficient than the default node file watcher. You can install it with `brew install watchman` if you are on a Mac. For other systems, you can check the installation guide on the [official watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

3. **Exclude unnecessary directories**: If your project is large, you might be watching too many files. You can exclude the unnecessary directories by adding a `watchmanconfig` file in your project root with the following content:

```json
{
  "ignore_dirs" : ["node_modules", "path/to/other/dir"]
}
```

Remember to replace `"path/to/other/dir"` with the actual paths you want to exclude.

4. **Upgrade your Node.js version**: This issue can also be caused by a bug in Node.js.
