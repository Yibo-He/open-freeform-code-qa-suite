In earlier versions of SQL Server, which do not have the TRIM function, you can use a combination of LTRIM and RTRIM functions to achieve the same result. LTRIM removes leading spaces and RTRIM removes trailing spaces. Here is how you can implement it:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) as TrimmedString
```

This code will remove both leading and trailing spaces from the @ss variable.
