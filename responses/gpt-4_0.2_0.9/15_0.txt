Sure, you can use `io.BytesIO` to save the figure to memory, and then open that as an image. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import io
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image:
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

This function first saves the figure to a `BytesIO` object in memory as a PNG image. Then it seeks to the beginning of this object and opens it as an `Image`. The resulting `Image` object is then returned.
