Yes, you can delete all the saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class in Flutter. 

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void logoutUser() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In this example, `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` is an asynchronous method that returns a future of `SharedPreferences`. Once you have the instance of `SharedPreferences`, you can call the `clear()` method on it to delete all the data.

Please note that `clear()` is also an asynchronous method, so you need to use `await` to make sure it completes before proceeding. 

You can call this `logoutUser()` function when the user taps on logout.
