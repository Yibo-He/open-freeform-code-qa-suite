The error you're encountering is likely due to VSCode not being able to find the package in your GOPATH or GOROOT. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Go installation and environment variables:**

   Make sure you have Go installed correctly and your GOPATH and GOROOT environment variables are set correctly. You can check these by running `go env` in your terminal.

2. **Install the package:**

   If you haven't done so already, install the Redigo package by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

   This will download and install the package in your GOPATH.

3. **Reload VSCode:**

   Sometimes, VSCode might not pick up the newly installed packages immediately. You can try reloading VSCode to see if this resolves the issue.

4. **Check your Go tools:**

   VSCode uses a set of Go tools to provide features like auto-completion and linting. You can update these tools by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), then typing and selecting "Go: Install/Update Tools".

5. **Check your import statement:**

   Make sure your import statement is correct. It should look something like this:

   ```go
   import (
       "github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis"
   )
   ```

6. **Check your Go version:**

   Some packages require a certain version of Go. Make sure your Go version is up to date or compatible with the Redigo package.
