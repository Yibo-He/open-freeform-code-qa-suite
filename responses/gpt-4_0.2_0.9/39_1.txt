This issue is usually caused by a problem with the library paths in your project. Here are a few more things you can try:

1. **Check your Library Search Paths**: Go to your project settings, select your target, and then go to "Build Settings". Look for "Library Search Paths" and make sure the paths listed there are correct. If there are any paths that don't exist, remove them.

2. **Check your Other Linker Flags**: In the same "Build Settings" tab, look for "Other Linker Flags". Make sure that the flags listed there are correct. If there are any flags that are not needed, remove them.

3. **Reinstall the libraries**: If the libraries are installed via CocoaPods, try deintegrating CocoaPods from your project using `pod deintegrate` and then reinstall them using `pod install`.

4. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that the libraries are correctly listed in your Podfile. If there are any libraries that are not needed, remove them.

5. **Check your Xcode version**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode. Some libraries may not work with older versions of Xcode.

6. **Check your iOS Deployment Target**: Make sure your iOS Deployment Target is not set to a version that is too old. Some libraries may not work with older iOS versions.

7. **Check the library's documentation**: Check the documentation of the libraries that are causing problems. There may be specific instructions or requirements for using the library with Xcode.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact the library's developers for help
