Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method provided by the SharedPreferences library in Flutter. 

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void logoutUser() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In this code, `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` is used to get an instance of SharedPreferences and `prefs.clear()` is used to delete all the data in SharedPreferences. This function can be called when the user taps on logout.
