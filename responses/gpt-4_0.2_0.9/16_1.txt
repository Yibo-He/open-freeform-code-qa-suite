Swagger Codegen is a powerful tool that allows you to generate client libraries automatically from a Swagger spec, which makes it easier to create a client to interact with your RESTful API. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen:

1. **Install Swagger Codegen**: If you haven't installed Swagger Codegen yet, you can download it from GitHub. You can use the following command to clone the repository and build the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git
    cd swagger-codegen
    mvn clean package
    ```

    This will create a runnable jar file in the `modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target` directory.

2. **Generate the Client Code**: Now, you can generate the client code using the Swagger Codegen CLI. The command to do this is:

    ```bash
    java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs -l java -o /path/to/output/directory
    ```

    Replace `http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs` with the URL of your Swagger spec, `java` with the desired client language, and `/path/to/output/directory` with the directory where you want the client code to be generated.

    Swagger Codegen supports many languages, not just Java. You can see the full list of supported languages by running the command:

    ```bash
    java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar langs
    ```
