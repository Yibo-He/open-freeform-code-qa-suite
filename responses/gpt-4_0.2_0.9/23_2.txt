The error message you're seeing suggests that Puppeteer is having trouble launching a browser instance. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as missing dependencies or incorrect permissions.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Install Puppeteer with bundled Chromium**: Sometimes, the version of Chromium that Puppeteer tries to use might not be compatible with your system. You can try installing Puppeteer with a bundled version of Chromium that's known to work with the library. You can do this by running `npm install puppeteer --save`.

2. **Check for missing dependencies**: If you're running your code in a Linux environment, there might be some missing libraries that Puppeteer needs to launch a browser instance. You can check for these by running the command `ldd chrome | grep not` on the command line, where `chrome` is the path to the Chromium or Chrome executable that Puppeteer is trying to use. This will list any missing libraries that you need to install.

3. **Check for correct permissions**: Puppeteer needs certain permissions to launch a browser instance. Make sure that the user running your Node.js code has the necessary permissions to launch a browser.

4. **Try running Puppeteer in headless mode**: Puppeteer can run in "headless" mode, which means it launches a browser instance without a user interface. This can sometimes help avoid issues with launching the browser. You can enable this by passing `{ headless: true }` to the `puppeteer.launch()` method.

5. **Update Puppeteer**: If you're using an older version of Puppeteer, you might run into compatibility issues with newer
