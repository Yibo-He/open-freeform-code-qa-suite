The error message you're seeing indicates that the linker is unable to find the libraries it needs. Here are a few more things you can try:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that all the libraries that you're trying to link are correctly listed in your Podfile. If any are missing, add them and run `pod install` again.

2. **Check your project's .xcconfig files**: These files are used by Xcode to set build settings. If the paths to your libraries are incorrect in these files, it could cause the error you're seeing. You can find these files in the same directory as your .xcodeproj file.

3. **Check your library versions**: Make sure that the versions of the libraries you're using are compatible with your version of Xcode and iOS. If they're not, you may need to update your libraries or downgrade your Xcode/iOS version.

4. **Reinstall CocoaPods**: Sometimes, issues can be resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling CocoaPods. You can do this by running `sudo gem uninstall cocoapods` followed by `sudo gem install cocoapods`.

5. **Check your system's library search paths**: It's possible that your system's library search paths are set incorrectly. You can check these by going to "Build Settings" and scrolling down to "Search Paths". Make sure that "Library Search Paths" is set to the correct location.

6. **Try a different build system**: Xcode uses a build system to compile and link your code. You can try switching to a different build system to see if that resolves your issue. You
