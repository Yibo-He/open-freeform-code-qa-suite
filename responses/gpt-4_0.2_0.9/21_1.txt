The error you're encountering is because the Python interpreter can't find the 'ujson' module in its path. This could be due to a variety of reasons, but it's likely that the module isn't being installed in the correct location.

Here's a modified version of your code that should work:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!conda install --channel defaults conda python=3.6 --yes
!conda update --channel defaults --all --yes
!conda install -c anaconda ujson --yes
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')
import ujson
```

This script does the following:

1. Downloads the latest Miniconda installer.
2. Makes the installer executable.
3. Installs Miniconda to '/usr/local'.
4. Updates Conda and Python to the latest version.
5. Installs 'ujson' using Conda.
6. Appends the path where 'ujson' is installed to the system path.
7. Imports 'ujson'.

Remember, Google Colab already has a Python environment set up, and installing Miniconda might interfere with it. It's generally recommended to use `!pip install` to install packages in Colab. If 'ujson' is available on PyPI,
