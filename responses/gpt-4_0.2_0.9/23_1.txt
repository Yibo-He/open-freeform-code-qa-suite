The error message you're seeing suggests that Puppeteer is having trouble launching the browser. This could be due to a number of reasons, but here are a few things you can try:

1. **Install Puppeteer with bundled Chromium**: If you didn't install Puppeteer with the bundled Chromium browser, you might be running into compatibility issues. You can install Puppeteer with Chromium by running `npm install puppeteer` or `yarn add puppeteer`.

2. **Run Puppeteer in headless mode**: By default, Puppeteer runs in headless mode (without a browser UI). If you've changed this setting, try running Puppeteer in headless mode again by adding `{ headless: true }` to the `puppeteer.launch()` function.

3. **Check your system's compatibility**: Puppeteer requires at least Node.js v8.0.0. Make sure your version of Node.js is up to date. Also, Puppeteer is known to have issues on some systems due to missing dependencies. You can check the Puppeteer troubleshooting guide for more information on this.

4. **Check for code errors**: Make sure that the `pdfOutput` variable in your `page.setContent(pdfOutput)` line is defined and contains valid HTML. Also, the `page.emulateMedia("screen")` line is deprecated in newer versions of Puppeteer. You should use `page.emulateMediaType('screen')` instead.

5. **Check your file path**: Make sure the path you're trying to save your PDF to (`routes/planiton/pdf/mypdf.pdf`) exists and that your Node.js process has permission to write to it.
