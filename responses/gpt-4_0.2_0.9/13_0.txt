In SwiftUI, both `List` and `ForEach` are used to display a collection of data, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors.

1. `List`: This is a container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column. It is similar to UITableView in UIKit. It is capable of handling dynamic data sets and provides default support for various features such as deletion and reordering of items. When you use a `List`, SwiftUI automatically creates a `ScrollView` and manages all the memory handling for you. 

2. `ForEach`: This is not a view but a structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data. It is used to perform actions on each element in a collection. It's similar to a for-in loop in Swift. In SwiftUI, `ForEach` is often used inside `List` to iterate over items and create views for each item in the collection.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(0..<5) { item in
                Text("Item \(item)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `List` is used as a container to hold the items, and `ForEach` is used to generate a `Text` view for each item in the range 0..<5.
