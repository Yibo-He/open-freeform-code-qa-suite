Yes, you can use a personal access token to clone, commit, and push to a GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd /tmp/<project_name>
```

3. Make changes to the repository and commit those changes:

```bash
# Make changes to the repository
git add .
git commit -m 'Your commit message'
```

4. Push the changes to the repository:

```bash
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```

Note: Replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and your project name respectively.

Remember to keep your personal access token secret. If your personal access token is compromised, you should revoke it immediately in GitHub settings.
