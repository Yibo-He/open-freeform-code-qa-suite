Swagger Codegen is a powerful tool that allows you to generate client libraries automatically from a Swagger spec, which makes it easier to create client apps that consume your APIs. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen:

1. **Install Swagger Codegen**: The first step is to install Swagger Codegen. If you have Homebrew installed, you can use the following command to install Swagger Codegen:

   ```
   brew install swagger-codegen
   ```

   If you are using Windows or Linux, you can download the Swagger Codegen jar file from its GitHub repository.

2. **Get the Swagger Spec File**: You need to have the Swagger spec file (in JSON or YAML format) of your REST server. This file contains the details of the API endpoints, request-response structure, etc. If you don't have it, you can generate it using tools like Swagger UI, Swagger Editor, or Springfox if your server is built with Spring Boot.

3. **Generate the Client Code**: Once you have the Swagger spec file, you can generate the client code using the following command:

   ```
   swagger-codegen generate -i /path/to/swagger/spec/file -l java -o /output/directory
   ```

   In this command, replace `/path/to/swagger/spec/file` with the path to your Swagger spec file, `java` with the language of your choice for the client (you can use languages like java, python, php, ruby, etc.), and `/output/directory` with the directory where you want the generated code to be saved.

4. **Check the Generated Code**:
