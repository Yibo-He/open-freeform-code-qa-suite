If you're using an older version of SQL Server that doesn't support the TRIM function, you can achieve the same result by using a combination of the LTRIM and RTRIM functions. LTRIM removes leading spaces and RTRIM removes trailing spaces. Here's how you can modify your code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) as TrimmedString
```

In this code, LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) will first remove any trailing spaces from @ss with RTRIM, and then remove any leading spaces with LTRIM. The result is a string with no leading or trailing spaces, which is the same as what TRIM would give you.
