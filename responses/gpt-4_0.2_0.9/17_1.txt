To use an alias in VSCode with IntelliSense, you need to configure both your project and VSCode settings. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `path-intellisense` extension in VSCode. This extension autocompletes filenames in your project.

2. Configure your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` (if you're using TypeScript) to include the path alias. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/node_modules/*"]
}
```

In this example, `@styles` is the alias for the `src/styled` directory.

3. Configure the `path-intellisense` extension to recognize the alias. Open the settings in VSCode (File > Preferences > Settings or `Ctrl + ,`) and search for `Path Intellisense Mappings`. Add a new entry with the alias and the corresponding path. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "path-intellisense.mappings": {
    "@styles": "${workspaceFolder}/src/styled"
  }
}
```

Now, when you type `@styles` in an import statement, VSCode should autocomplete with the files and directories in `src/styled`.

Please note that this setup assumes that your `src/styled` directory is at the root of your workspace. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the paths accordingly.
