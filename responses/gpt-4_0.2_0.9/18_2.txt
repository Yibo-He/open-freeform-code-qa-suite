This issue might be due to a few reasons. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check your GOPATH and GOROOT settings:** Make sure your GOPATH and GOROOT are set correctly. You can check these by running `go env` in your terminal. Your GOPATH should be the directory where your Go projects live, and GOROOT should be the directory where Go is installed.

2. **Check your Go version:** Make sure you're using a recent version of Go. You can check this by running `go version` in your terminal. If you're using an old version, consider upgrading.

3. **Check your package installation:** Make sure the Redigo package is correctly installed in your GOPATH. You can do this by looking in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis`. If it's not there, you can install it by running `go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis`.

4. **Check your import statement:** Make sure your import statement is correct. It should be `import "github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis"`.

5. **Check your VSCode settings:** Make sure VSCode is correctly configured to work with Go. You should have the Go extension installed, and your `go.gopath` and `go.goroot` settings should match what you see when you run `go env`.

6. **Try reloading VSCode:** Sometimes, simply reloading VSCode can fix the issue. You can do this by closing and reopening VSCode, or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
