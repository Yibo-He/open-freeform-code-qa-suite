To set up an alias like `@styles` in VSCode, you need to configure both your project's bundler (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, or Create React App) and the `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file.

Here's how to do it for a typical Webpack project:

1. Configure Webpack:

Open your `webpack.config.js` file and add the `resolve.alias` configuration:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@styles': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/styled/index'),
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

Make sure to adjust the path according to your project structure.

2. Configure `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`:

Create a `jsconfig.json` file in your project's root directory (or modify the existing one) and add the `compilerOptions.paths` configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles": ["src/styled/index"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

Again, adjust the path according to your project structure.

Now, VSCode should recognize the `@styles` alias and provide IntelliSense for it. You can import it like this:

```javascript
import { MyStyledComponent } from '@styles';
```

If you're using a different bundler or setup (e.g., Create React App, Parcel), the configuration might be slightly different. Let me know if you need help with a specific setup.
