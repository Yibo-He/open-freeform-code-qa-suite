This issue might be due to several reasons. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve it:

1. **Ensure the package is installed**: You can install the package by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
    ```

2. **Check your Go version**: Make sure you're using a version of Go that's compatible with the package. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

3. **Check your GOPATH and GOROOT**: Make sure your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables are set correctly. You can check these by running `echo $GOPATH` and `echo $GOROOT` in your terminal.

4. **Check your Go tools**: The Go extension for VSCode relies on several Go tools to provide features like auto-completion and go-to-definition. You can update these tools by opening the command palette in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+P), typing `Go: Install/Update Tools`, and selecting all the tools.

5. **Check your VSCode settings**: Make sure the `go.gopath` and `go.goroot` settings in VSCode are set correctly. You can check these by opening the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and searching for `go.gopath` and `go.goroot`.

6. **Reload VSCode**: Sometimes, simply reloading VSCode can fix the issue. You can do this by closing and reopening VSCode, or by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing `Reload Window`.

If none of these steps work, you might be dealing with a bug in VSCode or the Go extension. In that case, you should report the issue to the maintainers of the Go extension.
