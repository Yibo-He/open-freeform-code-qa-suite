I'm sorry to hear that you lost your work. It can be frustrating, especially when you're new to using Jupyter Notebook. Based on your description, it seems like there might have been an issue with the server connection, which prevented the notebook from saving properly.

Here are a few things you can try to recover your work:

1. **Check the browser's local storage:** Jupyter Notebook sometimes stores unsaved changes in the browser's local storage. To check this, open the notebook and press `Cmd + Shift + J` to open the browser's Developer Tools. Go to the "Application" tab, and look for "Local Storage" in the left sidebar. Click on the notebook's URL, and see if there's any data stored there. If you find any data, you can copy it and paste it into a new notebook.

2. **Check the terminal output:** If you still have the terminal open where you ran the Jupyter Notebook, check the output for any error messages or information about the saving process. This might give you some clues about what went wrong.

3. **Search for temporary files:** Sometimes, Jupyter Notebook creates temporary files with unsaved changes. Look for files with a `.ipynb` extension in your working directory and the `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder. You can also try searching your entire system for `.ipynb` files to see if there are any hidden copies.

4. **Check the Jupyter Notebook server logs:** If you have access to the server logs, you might be able to find more information about the saving process and any errors that occurred.

Unfortunately, if none of these methods work, it might be difficult to recover your lost work. In the future, to avoid this issue, you can:

- Make sure to save your work frequently by pressing `Cmd + S` or clicking `File` > `Save and Checkpoint`.
- Keep an eye on the server connection status in the top right corner of the notebook. If you see a "Not Connected" or "Connection Failed" message, try to resolve the issue before continuing to work.
- Regularly back up your work by downloading the notebook file or using a version control system like Git.

I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in recovering your work.
