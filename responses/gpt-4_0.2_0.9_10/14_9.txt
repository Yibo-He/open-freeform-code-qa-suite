To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by editing your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa', // can be 'universal' for server-side rendering
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to generate your static website. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

4. The `generate` command will create a `dist` directory, which contains your static website. You can deploy this directory to GitHub Pages.

Please note that GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side rendering (SSR). Therefore, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode.

Also, please note that you need to set the `base` option in your `nuxt.config.js` file to match the repository name on GitHub:

```javascript
export default {
  router: {
    base: '/<repository-name>/'
  }
}
```

5. Finally, you can use a package like `push-dir` to push the `dist` directory to gh-pages branch. Install it using:

```bash
npm install --save-dev push-dir
```

And add a deploy script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup"
}
```

Then you can run `npm run deploy` to deploy your site to GitHub Pages.
