The error message you're seeing is indicating that the linker is unable to find the libraries it needs. This can be caused by a variety of issues, but here are a few more things you can try:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that the libraries that are causing errors are correctly included in your Podfile. If they are missing, add them and run `pod install` again.

2. **Check your project's .pbxproj file**: This file is located in the .xcodeproj directory. Open it in a text editor and search for the paths that are causing errors. If you find them, delete these lines and try building again.

3. **Reinstall the libraries manually**: If the libraries were not installed via CocoaPods, try reinstalling them manually. You can usually find installation instructions on the library's GitHub page.

4. **Check your Xcode version**: Make sure you are using a version of Xcode that is compatible with the libraries you are trying to use.

5. **Check your library versions**: Make sure you are using versions of the libraries that are compatible with each other and with your version of Xcode.

6. **Try a different build location**: Go to Xcode Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> Advanced and change the build location to "Unique". This will ensure that each of your projects has its own build directory.

7. **Check your build settings**: Make sure that the "Always Search User Paths" setting is set to "No" in your build settings.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to create a new project and manually transfer your files over. This can help if the issue is caused by a corrupted project file.
