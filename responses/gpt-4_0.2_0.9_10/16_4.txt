To generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen, follow these steps:

1. **Install Swagger Codegen**: If you haven't installed Swagger Codegen yet, you can download it from [Swagger Codegen GitHub repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). You can either download the pre-built JAR file or build it from the source code. To build from source, you'll need Java and Maven installed on your system.

2. **Obtain the Swagger/OpenAPI specification**: You'll need the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file (in JSON or YAML format) for your REST server. This file describes the API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. If you don't have this file, you can generate it using tools like [Swagger Inspector](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-inspector/) or [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

3. **Choose a target language**: Decide which programming language you want to generate the REST client in. Swagger Codegen supports various languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, and more. You can find the full list of supported languages in the [Swagger Codegen documentation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen#overview).

4. **Generate the REST client**: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have the Swagger Codegen JAR file. Run the following command to generate the REST client:

```bash
java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i /path/to/swagger/specification.yaml -l target_language -o /path/to/output/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/swagger/specification.yaml` with the path to your Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, `target_language` with the language you want to generate the client in, and `/path/to/output/directory` with the directory where you want the generated client code to be saved.

For example, to generate a Python client, the command would look like this:

```bash
java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i /path/to/swagger/specification.yaml -l python -o /path/to/output/directory
```

5. **Use the generated REST client**: After the generation is complete, you'll find the REST client code in the specified output directory. You can now use this code in your application to interact with the REST server.
