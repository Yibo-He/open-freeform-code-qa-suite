Based on the error messages and the solutions you've tried, it seems like there might be an issue with the library search paths in your project settings. Here are a few more steps you can try:

1. **Check the Podfile**: Make sure your Podfile includes all the required libraries (AFNetworking, JSONModel, ReactiveCocoa, Realm, SAMKeychain, and Sentry). If any of them are missing, add them and run `pod install` again.

2. **Reset the Derived Data folder**: Sometimes, Xcode's derived data can cause issues. You can reset it by going to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> click the arrow to open the folder in Finder -> delete the folder related to your project`.

3. **Check the Library Search Paths in the project settings**:

   a. Go to your project settings by clicking on the project name in the Project Navigator.
   
   b. Select your target and go to the "Build Settings" tab.
   
   c. Search for "Library Search Paths" and make sure it includes the correct paths for all the libraries. You can use `$(inherited)` and `$(PROJECT_DIR)/Pods/build/Debug-iphonesimulator` as the search paths.

4. **Reinstall the CocoaPods**: If none of the above solutions work, try reinstalling CocoaPods:

   a. Uninstall CocoaPods by running `sudo gem uninstall cocoapods`.
   
   b. Install CocoaPods again by running `sudo gem install cocoapods`.
   
   c. Run `pod install` in your project directory.

After trying these steps, clean and build your project again. If the issue persists, consider creating a new project and migrating your code and resources to the new project. This can help eliminate any hidden issues with the project configuration.
