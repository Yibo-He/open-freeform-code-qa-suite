Yes, you can see the result graphs directly in Visual Studio Code itself by using the built-in Python Interactive Window. This feature is provided by the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.

Here are the steps:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code if you haven't already. You can do this by searching for "Python" in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).

2. Once the Python extension is installed, you can use the `#%%` comment to create cells in your code. When you run the cell using the `Run Cell` button that appears in the editor, the output will be shown in the Python Interactive Window.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
#%%

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

You just need to add `#%%` at the top of your code. When you hover over this line, you'll see a play button on the left. Click it to run the cell and the output will be displayed in the Python Interactive Window within Visual Studio Code.

Please note that you need to have a Python interpreter selected for this to work. You can select an interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the status bar, or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
