`List` and `ForEach` in SwiftUI serve different purposes:

1. `List`: A container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column. It is similar to a UITableView in UIKit. It has built-in support for scrolling and cell recycling for better performance.

Example:
```swift
List {
    Text("Row 1")
    Text("Row 2")
    Text("Row 3")
}
```

2. `ForEach`: A structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data. It is not a container like `List`, but a way to generate views in a loop. It can be used inside other views, including `List`.

Example:
```swift
VStack {
    ForEach(0..<3) { index in
        Text("Row \(index)")
    }
}
```

You can use `ForEach` inside a `List` to create dynamic rows based on a data collection:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(items) { item in
        Text(item.name)
    }
}
```
