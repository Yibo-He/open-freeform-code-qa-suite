Since you're using an early version of SQL Server that doesn't have the TRIM function, you can use a combination of LTRIM and RTRIM functions to achieve the same result. Here's the modified code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) AS TrimmedString
```

This code first removes the trailing spaces using RTRIM and then removes the leading spaces using LTRIM. The result is a trimmed string without leading or trailing spaces.
