This error occurs due to a misconfiguration in the signing configuration of your project. To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open `build.gradle` (Module: app) file.
2. Locate the `signingConfigs` block.
3. Make sure the `storeFile` property is using an absolute path, like this:

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file('/absolute/path/to/your/keystore.jks')
        // other configurations
    }
}
```

4. Sync your project and try generating the signed bundle again.
