To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) on a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update your `nuxt.config.js` file to set the `mode` to `'spa'`:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ... other configurations
}
```

2. Build the static files for your application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the static files for your application.

3. Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages. You can use the `gh-pages` npm package to simplify the deployment process. First, install the package as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

4. Add a deployment script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ... other scripts
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

5. Run the deployment script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will deploy the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository, making your Nuxt.js SPA available on GitHub Pages.
