The error message you're seeing is related to the linker not being able to find the libraries it needs. It seems you've tried a lot of the common solutions to this problem, but it still persists. Here are a few more things you can try:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that all the libraries that are giving you errors are included in your Podfile and that their versions are compatible with your project.

2. **Check your project's .pch file**: If your project has a .pch (precompiled header) file, make sure that it's not referencing any files or libraries that no longer exist or have been moved.

3. **Recreate the project**: If all else fails, you might want to try recreating the project. This is a last resort, but if there's some deep-seated corruption in your project settings, this might be the fastest way to resolve it.

4. **Check the Library Search Paths**: Go to Build Settings and search for "Library Search Paths". Make sure that the paths listed there are correct and that they contain the libraries that the linker is complaining about.

5. **Check the Linker Flags**: In Build Settings, search for "Other Linker Flags". Make sure that all the flags there are correct and that they're not causing the linker to look in the wrong place for your libraries.

6. **Check the Architectures**: In Build Settings, search for "Architectures" and "Valid Architectures". Make sure that these are set correctly for your project.

7. **Check the Derived Data**: Try deleting the Derived Data folder for your project. This folder can sometimes contain old or corrupted data that can cause problems. You can delete it by going to Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data, then click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder and move it to the Trash.

Remember to always clean and rebuild your project after making changes to the settings or the Podfile.
