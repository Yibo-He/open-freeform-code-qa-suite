This issue might be caused by a missing or incorrect Go tools installation or a misconfiguration in your VSCode settings. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Go extension for VSCode installed. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab in VSCode and searching for "Go".

2. Ensure that your Go tools are installed and up-to-date. You can update them by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and running the command `Go: Install/Update Tools`. Select all the tools and click "OK" to install/update them.

3. Check your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```
   echo $GOPATH
   echo $GOROOT
   ```

   If they are not set or incorrect, you can set them in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`), like this:

   ```
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go
   export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
   ```

   Replace the paths with the correct ones for your system. After updating the configuration file, restart your terminal and VSCode.

4. Make sure your VSCode settings are configured correctly. Open your settings.json file by going to File > Preferences > Settings, and click on the "{}" icon in the top right corner to open the JSON file. Check if you have the following settings:

   ```json
   "go.gopath": "${env:GOPATH}",
   "go.goroot": "${env:GOROOT}",
   "go.inferGopath": true,
   "go.toolsGopath": "${env:GOPATH}",
   ```

   If not, add them and save the file. Restart VSCode after making these changes.

5. If you're using Go modules, make sure you have initialized your project with `go mod init`. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```
   go mod init <module-name>
   ```

   Replace `<module-name>` with your desired module name, usually the repository path (e.g., `github.com/username/projectname`). After running this command, a `go.mod` file will be created in your project directory.

After trying these steps, the error should be resolved, and
