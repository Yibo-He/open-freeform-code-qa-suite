Yes, you can clear all shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class in Flutter. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void clearPreferences() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

In this example, `clearPreferences` is an asynchronous function that gets the instance of `SharedPreferences` and calls the `clear` method on it. This will delete all of the data stored in shared preferences.

You can call this function when the user taps on logout.
