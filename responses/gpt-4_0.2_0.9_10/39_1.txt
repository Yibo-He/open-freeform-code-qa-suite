The error message you're seeing is related to the linker not being able to find the libraries specified in your project settings. The linker is the part of the build process that combines your code with the libraries it uses.

Here are a few more things you can try:

1. **Check your Library Search Paths:** Go to your project settings and check the "Library Search Paths" under "Build Settings". Make sure the paths are correct and the libraries are actually there. If the paths are wrong, correct them.

2. **Check your Linked Frameworks and Libraries:** Go to your project settings and check the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" under "General". Make sure all the libraries are included and they are at the correct path.

3. **Re-add the libraries:** If the libraries are not found, try removing and re-adding them. Sometimes, Xcode can lose track of them, especially if they have been moved or deleted.

4. **Check your Podfile:** If you're using CocoaPods, check your Podfile to make sure all the libraries are included and the versions are correct. Then run `pod install` again.

5. **Check your compiler settings:** Go to your project settings and check the "Other Linker Flags" and "Header Search Paths" under "Build Settings". Make sure they are correct.

6. **Recreate the project:** If none of the above works, you might want to consider recreating the project. This is a last resort, but sometimes Xcode projects can become corrupted and the easiest way to fix them is to start over.

Remember to always backup your project before making any major changes.
