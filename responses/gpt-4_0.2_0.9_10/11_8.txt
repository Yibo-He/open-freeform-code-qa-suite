Sure, you can use a combination of LTRIM and RTRIM functions to achieve the same result as TRIM in earlier versions of SQL Server. Here's the modified code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) AS TrimmedValue
```

This code will remove both leading and trailing spaces from the `@ss` variable.
