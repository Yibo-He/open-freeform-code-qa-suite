Sure, here is the completed Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def draw_histogram():
  x = np.random.randn(100000)
  plt.hist(x, bins=20, edgecolor='black')
  plt.title('Histogram of np.random.randn')
  plt.xlabel('Value')
  plt.ylabel('Frequency')
  plt.grid(True)
  plt.savefig('figure.pdf')

draw_histogram()
```

In this code, `np.random.randn(100000)` generates 100,000 random numbers from the standard normal distribution. `plt.hist(x, bins=20, edgecolor='black')` creates a histogram with 20 bins from the data in `x`. The `edgecolor='black'` argument makes the edges of the bins black for better visibility. `plt.savefig('figure.pdf')` saves the figure as a PDF file named `figure.pdf`. The `draw_histogram()` function is then called to generate and save the histogram.
