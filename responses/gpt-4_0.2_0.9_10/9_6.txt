In Flutter, the `BottomNavigationBar` widget does not have a direct property to change its height. However, there are a few workarounds to achieve this:

1. **Wrap it in a Container and set the height:**

This method is not recommended because it may cause layout issues. But you can try it if you want.

```dart
Container(
  height: 50, // Set this to the height you want.
  child: BottomNavigationBar(
    // Your BottomNavigationBar code here.
  ),
)
```

2. **Use `BottomAppBar` instead:**

`BottomAppBar` is more flexible and customizable than `BottomNavigationBar`. You can use it to create a similar effect with a customizable height.

```dart
BottomAppBar(
  child: Container(
    height: 50, // Set this to the height you want.
    child: Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        // Your navigation bar items here.
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
```

3. **Create a custom widget:**

If the above methods do not meet your needs, you can create a custom widget that mimics the behavior of `BottomNavigationBar` but with a customizable height.

Remember, Flutter encourages widget composition. If the built-in widgets do not meet your needs, you can always create your own.
