It seems like you have two issues here. Let's address them one by one.

1. Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle

This error is related to the location package. It seems like the location_web plugin is missing. To fix this issue, open your `pubspec.yaml` file and make sure you have the correct version of the location package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  location: ^4.3.0 # or the latest version
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to update the dependencies.

2. Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'

This error is because you are trying to use a `Future<String>` as a URL for the `Image.network()` widget. You should use a `FutureBuilder` to handle the asynchronous call to `_getUserLocation()`.

Update your `NearbyScreen` widget like this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
              } else {
                return Image.network(snapshot.data);
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This will display a CircularProgressIndicator while the image URL is being fetched, and then display the image once the URL is available. If there's an error, it will display the error message.
