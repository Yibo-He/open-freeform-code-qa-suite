This error is usually caused by a misconfiguration in the signing configurations of your Android project. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Check your `build.gradle` file and make sure the `storeFile` path is correct. It should be something like this:

```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('keystore.jks') // replace 'keystore.jks' with your keystore file
            // other configurations...
        }
    }
    // other configurations...
}
```

2. If the `storeFile` path is relative (like in the example above), it is relative to the module's directory, not the project's root directory. Make sure your keystore file is in the correct location.

3. If the `storeFile` path is absolute, make sure the path is correct and the keystore file exists at that location.

4. If you are using environment variables or properties from `local.properties` to specify the `storeFile` path, make sure they are correctly set.

5. Clean and rebuild your project. Sometimes, the build cache can cause issues. You can clean your project by selecting `Build > Clean Project` from the Android Studio menu, and then rebuild it by selecting `Build > Rebuild Project`.

6. If none of the above solutions work, try invalidating the caches and restarting Android Studio. You can do this by selecting `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...` from the Android Studio menu.
