To configure VSCode to recognize your module path aliases, you need to modify your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file (if you're using TypeScript) to include a `paths` property in the `compilerOptions` object.

Here's an example of how you can set it up:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

In this example, `@styles` is the alias for the `src/styled` directory. The `*` after `@styles/` and `src/styled/` allows you to import any file in the `src/styled` directory.

After you've saved your changes, you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.

Now, you should be able to import from `@styles` like this:

```javascript
import MyStyledComponent from '@styles/MyStyledComponent';
```

And VSCode will provide IntelliSense for the `@styles` path.
