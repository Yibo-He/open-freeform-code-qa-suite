Yes, you can use your personal access token to clone, commit, and push to your GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
cd /tmp

# Clone the repository
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd <project_name>

# Make changes to your files here

# Stage the changes for commit
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m 'Your commit message'

# Push the changes to the repository
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and your project name respectively.

Please note that it's not a good practice to hardcode your personal access token in your commands. It's recommended to use a credential helper to manage your tokens.
