This error is caused by a misconfiguration in the signing configuration of your project. To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open your project's `build.gradle` file (the one inside the `app` folder).
2. Locate the `signingConfigs` block.
3. Make sure that the `storeFile` property is set to the correct path of your keystore file. Use `file()` method to define the path, like this:

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file('path/to/your/keystore.jks')
        storePassword 'your_store_password'
        keyAlias 'your_key_alias'
        keyPassword 'your_key_password'
    }
}
```

4. Sync your project with Gradle files and try generating the signed bundle again.
