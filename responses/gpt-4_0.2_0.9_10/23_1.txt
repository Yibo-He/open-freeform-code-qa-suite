The error you're encountering is related to the Puppeteer browser launch. It might be caused by missing dependencies or incorrect configurations. Here are a few suggestions to resolve the issue:

1. Install the required dependencies:

If you're using a Linux-based system, you might need to install some additional dependencies for Puppeteer. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxi6 libxext6 libxtst6 libnss3 libcups2 libxss1 libxrandr2 libasound2 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libgtk-3-0
```

2. Use the bundled Chromium version:

By default, Puppeteer uses a bundled version of Chromium. Make sure you have installed Puppeteer with the bundled Chromium by running:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

3. Launch Puppeteer with additional flags:

You can try launching Puppeteer with additional flags to disable the sandbox and enable no-sandbox mode. Update your `puppeteer.launch()` line to include these flags:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true, args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'] });
```

4. Check your environment variables:

Ensure that the `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` environment variable is not set to `true`. If it is, Puppeteer will not download Chromium, which might cause the error.

5. Reinstall Puppeteer:

Sometimes, reinstalling Puppeteer can fix the issue. Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` again:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

After trying these suggestions, your issue should be resolved. If you still encounter the error, please provide more information about your system and environment, such as the operating system, Node.js version, and Puppeteer version.
