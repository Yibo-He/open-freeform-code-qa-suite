It seems like you have imported the `FlexLayoutModule` correctly in your `app.module.ts`. To use it in your `login-view` component, you need to make sure that you have added the appropriate directives in the component's HTML template.

Here's an example of how to use Angular Flex Layout in your `login-view` component:

1. Open your `login-view.component.html` file.

2. Add the Flex Layout directives to your HTML elements, for example:

```html
<div fxLayout="column" fxLayoutAlign="center center" fxFlex="100">
  <mat-card>
    <mat-card-header>
      <mat-card-title>Login</mat-card-title>
    </mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-content>
      <!-- Your login form goes here -->
    </mat-card-content>
    <mat-card-actions>
      <button mat-raised-button color="primary">Login</button>
    </mat-card-actions>
  </mat-card>
</div>
```

In this example, I have used the `fxLayout`, `fxLayoutAlign`, and `fxFlex` directives to create a simple login card that is centered both horizontally and vertically.

3. Save the changes and check if the layout is working as expected in your `login-view` component.

If you still face any issues, make sure that you have installed the `@angular/flex-layout` package using the following command:

```
npm install @angular/flex-layout
```

Also, ensure that you have the latest version of Angular Flex Layout that is compatible with Angular 9. You can check the compatibility table in the [official documentation](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/README.md#installation).
