Yes, you can use the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` package to delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, add the `shared_preferences` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.8
```

2. Import the package in the file where you want to clear the shared preferences:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
```

3. Create a function to clear all shared preferences:

```dart
Future<void> clearAllSharedPreferences() async {
  final SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.clear();
}
```

4. Call this function when the user taps on the logout button:

```dart
onPressed: () async {
  await clearAllSharedPreferences();
  // Navigate to the login screen or perform other logout actions
},
```

Now, when the user taps on the logout button, all saved shared preferences will be deleted in a single shot.
