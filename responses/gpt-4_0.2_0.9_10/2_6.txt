Yes, you can see the result graphs directly in Visual Studio Code itself using the built-in Python Interactive Window. Here's how to do it:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code if you haven't already. You can find it in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) by searching for "Python" and clicking the Install button for the extension by Microsoft.

2. Add the following line at the beginning of your code to enable the `%matplotlib inline` magic command, which will display the plots inline in the Python Interactive Window:

```python
# %%
```

3. Your updated code should look like this:

```python
# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

4. To run the code in the Python Interactive Window, place your cursor on the line with `# %%` and click the "Run Cell" button that appears to the left of the line, or press `Shift+Enter`.

The plot should now be displayed directly in the Python Interactive Window within Visual Studio Code.
