Yes, you can use personal access tokens to clone, commit, and push. Here's a brief example:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```
cd <project_name>
```

3. Make changes to the files, then stage and commit:
```
git add <file>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

4. Push the changes:
```
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git <branch_name>
```

Replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, `<project_name>`, `<file>`, and `<branch_name>` with the appropriate values.
