There are no official guidelines for naming getters and setters after Java 14. However, you can follow these suggestions:

1. For new code using records, use the auto-generated getter methods (e.g., `person.name()`).
2. For existing Java beans or classes that cannot be converted to records, continue using the Java bean convention (e.g., `getName()` and `setName()`).
3. Strive for consistency within a single class or module. If you mix styles, it may cause confusion.

Until there are official guidelines, it's essential to maintain readability and consistency within your codebase.
