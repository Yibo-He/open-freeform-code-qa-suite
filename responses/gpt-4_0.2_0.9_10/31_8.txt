Yes, you can use a personal access token to clone, commit, and push to a GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
cd /tmp

# Clone the repository
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd <project_name>

# Make changes to the repository
# ...

# Stage the changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the changes
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Remember to replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and the name of your project, respectively. 

Also, note that you should be careful with your personal access token and avoid sharing it with others. It's equivalent to your password on GitHub.
