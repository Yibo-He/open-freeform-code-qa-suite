To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by setting the `mode` to `spa` in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to generate a `dist` directory with your compiled application. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

4. Now, you can deploy the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages. If you want to automate this process, you can use a package like `push-dir`. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev push-dir
```

5. Then, you can add a `deploy` script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup"
}
```

6. Finally, you can deploy your application to GitHub Pages by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, which GitHub Pages can use to host your application.

Remember to replace the `base` property in `nuxt.config.js` with your repository's name:

```javascript
export default {
  router: {
    base: '/<repository-name>/'
  }
}
```

This is necessary because GitHub Pages serves your site from a subpath like `username.github.io/repository-name/`.
