There are no official or semi-official guidelines on how to name getters and setters after Java 14. The JavaBeans naming conventions (`getName()`, `setName()`) are still widely used and accepted. 

Java 14 introduced records as a way to reduce boilerplate code for data carrier classes, not as a replacement for the JavaBeans convention. The `name()` style getter is specific to records and is not meant to replace the `getName()` style in all classes.

In a mixed codebase, it's recommended to stick with the JavaBeans convention for regular classes and use the record-specific style only for records. This way, the type of class (record vs regular class) can be inferred from the getter style. 

If you want to make your codebase more consistent, you could consider using Lombok's `@Data` or `@Value` annotations, which generate getters in the JavaBeans style for you, even for records.
