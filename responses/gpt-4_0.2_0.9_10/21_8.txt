Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the updated cell:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!conda install -q -y --prefix /usr/local ujson
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/')
import ujson
```

Here's what's changed:

1. I added a `chmod +x` command to make the downloaded script executable.
2. I changed the conda install command to use the `-q` (quiet) option to reduce the output, and removed the unnecessary packages.
3. I updated the path to the site-packages directory to reflect the Python version that comes with the latest Miniconda (Python 3.7).
4. I removed the lines that modify the `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` environment variables, as they are not necessary for importing the installed packages.

Please note that the Python version in the site-packages path may need to be updated if the Python version included with Miniconda changes in the future.
