You are getting the `IsADirectoryError` because you are trying to copy a file to a directory without specifying the destination filename. You need to include the filename in the destination path. Here's the completed function:

```python
from shutil import copyfile
import os

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        src = item[0]
        dest = os.path.join(destFolder, os.path.basename(src))
        copyfile(src, dest)
```

This function takes a `fileList` and a `destFolder` as input. It iterates through the `fileList`, extracts the source file path, and constructs the destination file path by joining the `destFolder` with the basename of the source file path. Then, it uses `copyfile` to copy the file from the source to the destination.
