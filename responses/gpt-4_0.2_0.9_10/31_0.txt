Yes, you can use your personal access token to clone, commit, and push to your GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
cd /tmp

# Clone the repository
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd <project_name>

# Make changes to your files here

# Stage the changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m 'Your commit message'

# Push the changes
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, your personal access token, and your project name, respectively.

Remember to keep your personal access token secure and do not expose it in your scripts or version control systems.
