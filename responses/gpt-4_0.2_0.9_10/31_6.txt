Yes, you can use the personal access token for cloning, committing, and pushing. Here's the process:

1. Clone the repository:
```
cd /tmp
git clone https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git
```

2. Change to the project directory and make changes:
```
cd /tmp/<project_name>
# Make changes to the files
```

3. Commit the changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

4. Push the changes:
```
git push https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com/<username>/<project_name>.git master
```

Replace `<username>`, `<personal_access_token>`, and `<project_name>` with your GitHub username, personal access token, and project name, respectively.
