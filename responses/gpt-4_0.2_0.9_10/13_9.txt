`List` and `ForEach` in SwiftUI serve different purposes:

1. `List`: A container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column. It is similar to a UITableView in UIKit. It supports scrolling, cell recycling, and other built-in features.

```swift
List(items) { item in
    Text(item.name)
}
```

2. `ForEach`: A structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data. It is not a container like `List`, but a way to generate views in a loop. You can use it inside other views, like `List`, `VStack`, or `HStack`.

```swift
ForEach(items) { item in
    Text(item.name)
}
```

In summary, `List` is a container for displaying rows of data, while `ForEach` is a way to generate views from a collection. You can use `ForEach` inside a `List` to create dynamic rows based on a data collection.
