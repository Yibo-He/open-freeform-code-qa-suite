This error is usually caused by a misconfiguration in your signing configuration in your `build.gradle` file. 

The error message `'other' has different root` usually means that the paths of your keystore file and the project are on different drives or partitions.

To fix this issue, you should move your keystore file to the same drive or partition as your project. 

For example, if your project is located in `C:\Users\YourName\AndroidStudioProjects\YourProject`, you should also place your keystore file somewhere in `C:` drive. 

Then, update the `storeFile` field in your `build.gradle` file to point to the new location of your keystore file.

Here is an example of how your signing configuration might look like:

```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('keystore.jks') // Update this to your keystore file path
            storePassword 'yourStorePassword'
            keyAlias 'yourKeyAlias'
            keyPassword 'yourKeyPassword'
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to replace `'keystore.jks'`, `'yourStorePassword'`, `'yourKeyAlias'`, and `'yourKeyPassword'` with your actual keystore file path and credentials.
