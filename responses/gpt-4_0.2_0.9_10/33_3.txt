The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the location package. It seems like the location package is not properly installed or there is a version conflict. 

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Update your `pubspec.yaml` file to use the latest version of the location package.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the latest packages.
3. Run `flutter clean` to clean your build.
4. Finally, rebuild your project.

For the second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it seems like you're trying to convert a Future into a String directly which is not possible. 

The `_getUserLocation()` function is asynchronous and returns a Future. You cannot use it directly as a String. You need to `await` the Future to complete and then use the result.

You can use a `FutureBuilder` to handle this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (ctx, snapshot) {
              // While the Future is not completed show a loading spinner
              if (!snapshot.hasData) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              }
              // When the Future completes, show the image
              return Image.network(snapshot.data);
            },
          ),
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, `FutureBuilder` will handle the Future and rebuild the widget when the Future completes. If the Future is not completed, it will show a loading spinner. When the Future completes, it will show the image.
