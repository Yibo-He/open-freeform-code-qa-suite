`List` and `ForEach` in SwiftUI are both used to display a collection of data, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors.

1. `List`: This is a container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column. It is similar to UITableView in UIKit. It creates and manages a scrolling list of views derived from its input data.

```swift
List(0..<5) { item in
    Text("Item \(item)")
}
```

2. `ForEach`: This is a structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data. It doesn't provide any user interface. It's just a way to generate multiple views from a collection. It's often used inside other views, like `List` or `HStack`.

```swift
ForEach(0..<5) { item in
    Text("Item \(item)")
}
```

In the above example, `ForEach` is used to generate multiple `Text` views.

So, the main difference is that `List` is a view that has a visual representation and can be displayed on its own, while `ForEach` is used to generate views from a collection and doesn't have a visual representation on its own. It needs to be used inside other views.
