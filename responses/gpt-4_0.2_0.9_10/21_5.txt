The error message indicates that the Python interpreter is unable to find the 'ujson' module. This could be due to a number of reasons, but it's likely that the module is not installed in the correct location, or the Python interpreter is looking in the wrong place.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!conda install --channel defaults conda python=3.6 --yes
!conda update --channel defaults --all --yes
!conda install -c anaconda ujson --yes
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/')
import ujson
```

This script does the following:

1. Downloads the latest version of Miniconda.
2. Makes the downloaded shell script executable.
3. Installs Miniconda to the specified path.
4. Installs Python 3.6 using conda.
5. Updates all packages.
6. Installs the 'ujson' package from the Anaconda channel.
7. Appends the path to the site-packages directory (where 'ujson' is installed) to the system path.
8. Imports the 'ujson' module.

Please note that the 'os' module is not used in this script, so there's no need to import it. If you need to use it in your code, you can add 'import os' at the beginning of the script.
