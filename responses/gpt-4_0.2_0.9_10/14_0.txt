To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) on a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update your `nuxt.config.js` file to set the `mode` to `'spa'`:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ... other configurations
}
```

2. Build your project for production by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the static files for your SPA.

3. Create a `404.html` file in the `dist` folder with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Page not found</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      sessionStorage.redirect = location.href;
    </script>
    <script>
      location.replace(location.pathname.replace(/^\/[^\/]+$/, "/index.html"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This file will handle the routing for your SPA on GitHub Pages.

4. Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages. You can use the `gh-pages` npm package to make this process easier. First, install the package as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

5. Add a deployment script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ... other scripts
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

6. Run the deployment script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will deploy your Nuxt.js SPA to GitHub Pages. Make sure your GitHub repository is properly configured to use the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages deployment.
