It seems like the issue is related to SSL/TLS configuration. Your application is running on HTTPS, which requires a valid SSL certificate. Since you're using localhost, you might need to create a self-signed certificate for development purposes.

Here are the steps to create a self-signed certificate and configure your Spring Boot application to use it:

1. Create a self-signed certificate using the Java keytool:

```bash
keytool -genkey -alias selfsigned_localhost_sslserver -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 700 -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -keystore ssl-server.jks -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Localhost, O=Localhost, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown"
```

This command will create a self-signed certificate named `ssl-server.jks` with the password `changeit`. You can change the password and other details as needed.

2. Place the generated `ssl-server.jks` file in your Spring Boot project's `src/main/resources` directory.

3. Update your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file to include the SSL configuration:

For `application.properties`:

```properties
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:ssl-server.jks
server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
server.ssl.key-password=changeit
server.ssl.key-alias=selfsigned_localhost_sslserver
server.ssl.key-store-type=JKS
server.port=8080
```

For `application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  ssl:
    key-store: classpath:ssl-server.jks
    key-store-password: changeit
    key-password: changeit
    key-alias: selfsigned_localhost_sslserver
    key-store-type: JKS
  port: 8080
```

4. Restart your Spring Boot application using `mvnw`.

5. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8080`. You might see a warning about the certificate being not secure or not trusted. This is expected since it's a self-signed certificate. Proceed with caution and accept the certificate for development purposes.

If you still face issues, make sure there are no other applications running on port 8080. If the problem persists, you can try changing the port in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file and restart the application.
