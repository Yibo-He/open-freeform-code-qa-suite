To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by setting the `mode` to `'spa'` in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Build your application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, the next step is to deploy it. Nuxt.js generates your application and puts the files in the `dist` directory by default. You can deploy this directory to GitHub Pages.

However, GitHub Pages expects your files to be in the `docs` directory on the `master` branch for project pages. So, you need to configure Nuxt.js to generate your project in the `docs` directory. You can do this by setting the `generate.dir` option in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  generate: {
    dir: 'docs'
  },
  // ...
}
```

4. Now, you can generate your application:

```bash
npm run generate
```

5. After generating your application, commit and push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push
```

6. Finally, go to your repository settings on GitHub, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the `master branch /docs folder` as your source.

Your application should now be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

Please replace `<username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository>` with the name of your GitHub repository.
