Yes, you can see the result graphs in Visual Studio Code itself directly by using the built-in Python Interactive Window. This feature is provided by the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.

Here are the steps to do it:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code if you haven't done so already. You can do this by clicking on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`, then searching for `Python` and installing it.

2. Open your Python file.

3. Select the code that you want to run in the Interactive Window.

4. Right-click the selected code and click on `Run Selection/Line in Python Interactive Window`. Alternatively, you can press `Shift+Enter` to run the code.

5. The Python Interactive Window will open and display the output of your code, including any matplotlib plots.

Here is your code, no changes are needed:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Just select this code and run it in the Python Interactive Window as described above. The plot will be displayed directly in Visual Studio Code.
