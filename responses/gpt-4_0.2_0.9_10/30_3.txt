This error is often caused by a mismatch between the paths of the keystore file and the project. 

Here are some steps to fix it:

1. Open the `build.gradle` file of your app module.
2. Check the `signingConfigs` block. It should look something like this:

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file('keystore.jks') // check this line
        storePassword 'password'
        keyAlias 'alias'
        keyPassword 'password'
    }
}
```

3. The `storeFile` line should contain the relative path to your keystore file from the project directory. If it's not, correct it.
4. If the path is correct, try using an absolute path instead. For example:

```groovy
storeFile file('/Users/username/path/to/your/keystore.jks')
```

5. After making changes, sync the project with Gradle files and try to build the signed bundle again.

Remember to replace `/Users/username/path/to/your/keystore.jks` with the actual path to your keystore file.
