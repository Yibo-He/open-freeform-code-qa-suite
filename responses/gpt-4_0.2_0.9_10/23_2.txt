The error message `Failed to launch the browser process` is quite common when using Puppeteer. It usually means that Puppeteer is unable to start the Chromium browser for some reason. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Install Puppeteer with bundled Chromium**: If you didn't install Puppeteer with the bundled Chromium, you might want to try that. You can do this by running `npm install puppeteer` or `yarn add puppeteer`.

2. **Check your system dependencies**: Puppeteer requires certain system dependencies. If these are not met, Puppeteer might fail to launch. You can check the Puppeteer documentation for a list of these dependencies.

3. **Try running Puppeteer in no-sandbox mode**: This is not recommended for production environments as it can pose a security risk, but it can help you determine if sandboxing is the issue. You can do this by passing `--no-sandbox` to the `args` option when launching Puppeteer:

   ```javascript
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
     args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'],
   });
   ```

4. **Check your path**: Make sure the path where you are trying to save the PDF exists. In your case, the path is `routes/planiton/pdf/mypdf.pdf`.

5. **Check for any active instances of Puppeteer**: If there are any active instances of Puppeteer running, try closing them and running your script again.

6. **Update Puppeteer**: If you're using an older version of Puppeteer, try updating to the latest version.
