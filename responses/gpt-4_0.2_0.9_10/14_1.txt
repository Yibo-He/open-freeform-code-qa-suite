To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) on a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update your `nuxt.config.js` file to set the target to 'static' and the `ssr` property to `false`:

```javascript
export default {
  target: 'static',
  ssr: false,
  // ... other configurations
}
```

2. Install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

3. Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt",
  "build": "nuxt build",
  "start": "nuxt start",
  "generate": "nuxt generate",
  "deploy": "nuxt generate && gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

4. Build and deploy your Nuxt.js SPA to GitHub Pages by running the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will generate the static files in the `dist` folder and deploy them to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository. Make sure your repository is properly configured to use GitHub Pages with the `gh-pages` branch as the source.
