In Flutter, the `BottomNavigationBar` widget does not provide a direct way to customize its height. The height of the `BottomNavigationBar` is defined by the Material Design specification and Flutter adheres to these guidelines.

However, if you want to customize the height, you can create your own custom widget. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:

```dart
class CustomNavigationBar extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 50, // Set this to the height you want.
      child: BottomNavigationBar(
        items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.business),
            label: 'Business',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.school),
            label: 'School',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `BottomNavigationBar` is wrapped in a `Container` widget, and the height of the `Container` is set to the desired height. However, please note that setting the height too low may cause the icons and text in the `BottomNavigationBar` to be clipped.

Also, keep in mind that this approach may not adhere to the Material Design guidelines. If you want to maintain adherence to these guidelines, you may need to adjust the size of the icons and text in the `BottomNavigationBar` instead of changing the height of the `BottomNavigationBar` itself.
