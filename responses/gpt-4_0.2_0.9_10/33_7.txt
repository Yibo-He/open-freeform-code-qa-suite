It seems like there are two issues in your code. Let's address them one by one.

1. The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the `location` package. To fix this, open the `settings.gradle` file in the `android` folder of your project and add the following lines:

```gradle
include ':location_web'
project(':location_web').projectDir = new File('../location_web')
```

2. The second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to use a `Future<String>` as a URL directly. You need to use a `FutureBuilder` to handle the asynchronous call properly.

Update your `NearbyScreen` widget as follows:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
              } else {
                return Image.network(snapshot.data);
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This will properly handle the asynchronous call to `_getUserLocation()` and display the image once the URL is available.
