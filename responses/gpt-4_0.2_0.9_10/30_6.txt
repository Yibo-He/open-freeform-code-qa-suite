This error is usually caused by a misconfiguration in the signing configuration of your Android project. It's likely that the paths to your keystore file are not correctly set.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check your `build.gradle` file and ensure that the `signingConfigs` block is correctly configured. The `storeFile` property should point to the correct location of your keystore file.

```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('path_to_your_keystore_file')
            storePassword 'your_keystore_password'
            keyAlias 'your_key_alias'
            keyPassword 'your_key_password'
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

2. Make sure that the path to your keystore file is either absolute or relative to the project root directory.

3. If you're using environment variables to store your keystore path, ensure that they're correctly set in your system.

4. If you're using the Android Studio's 'Generate Signed Bundle / APK' dialog, ensure that the keystore path is correctly set there as well.

5. Clean and rebuild your project. Sometimes, the build cache can cause issues. You can clean your project by selecting `Build > Clean Project` from the Android Studio menu. Then, rebuild your project by selecting `Build > Rebuild Project`.

If none of these steps solve your issue, please provide more details about your setup and the exact steps you're taking when the error occurs.
