The error message `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` usually occurs when the Flutter project is not properly configured for web support. However, since you're developing an Android app, this error might be irrelevant. 

The second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you're trying to use a `Future<String>` as a `String`. The `_getUserLocation()` method is asynchronous, which means it returns a `Future<String>`, not a `String`. 

You need to use a `FutureBuilder` to handle the `Future` returned by `_getUserLocation()`. Here's how you can modify your `NearbyScreen` widget:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170, 
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (ctx, snapshot) {
              // Check if the Future is resolved
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              } else {
                if (snapshot.error != null) {
                  // Handle error...
                  return Center(child: Text('An error occurred!'));
                } else {
                  // If the Future is complete, display the image
                  return Image.network(snapshot.data);
                }
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, `FutureBuilder` takes a `Future` and a `builder` function. The `builder` function is called every time the `Future`'s state changes. If the `Future` is still waiting to complete, a loading spinner is shown. If the `Future` completes with an error, an error message is shown. If the `Future` completes successfully, the image is displayed.
