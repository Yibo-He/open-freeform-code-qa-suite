In Flutter, the `BottomNavigationBar` widget does not provide a direct way to customize its height. The height is determined by the Material Design guidelines, which Flutter adheres to.

However, there are a few workarounds to achieve a similar effect:

1. **Use a `Container` widget**: You can wrap your `BottomNavigationBar` inside a `Container` widget and then set the height of the `Container`. However, this may lead to visual artifacts as the `BottomNavigationBar` will try to expand to its default height.

```dart
Container(
  height: 50, // Set this to the height you want.
  child: BottomNavigationBar(
    // Your BottomNavigationBar code here.
  ),
)
```

2. **Create a custom widget**: If you want more control over the appearance and behavior of your bottom navigation bar, you can create a custom widget. This will allow you to set the height and other properties as you wish.

```dart
class CustomNavigationBar extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 50, // Set this to the height you want.
      child: Row(
        children: <Widget>[
          // Your custom navigation bar items here.
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Remember that the Material Design guidelines are there for a reason, and it's generally a good idea to stick to them unless you have a good reason not to. If you make your bottom navigation bar too small, it may be difficult for users to tap on the items.
