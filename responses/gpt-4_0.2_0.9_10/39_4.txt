Based on the error messages and the solutions you've already tried, it seems like there might be an issue with the library search paths in your project settings. Here are a few more suggestions to try:

1. **Check the Library Search Paths in your project settings:**

   - Go to your project settings by selecting the project in the Project Navigator.
   - Select your target and go to the "Build Settings" tab.
   - Search for "Library Search Paths" and make sure the paths are correct and include the necessary libraries.

2. **Remove any unnecessary search paths:**

   - In the "Library Search Paths" settings, remove any paths that are not needed or are incorrect.
   - Clean and build the project again.

3. **Check the Podfile:**

   - Make sure your Podfile includes all the necessary libraries and their correct versions.
   - Run `pod install` and `pod update` again to ensure the libraries are properly installed.

4. **Recreate the Xcode project:**

   - If none of the above solutions work, you can try creating a new Xcode project and migrating your source files and resources to the new project.
   - Make sure to properly set up the new project with the necessary libraries and settings.

5. **Check for any issues with the libraries themselves:**

   - It's possible that there might be an issue with the libraries themselves, such as a compatibility issue with your current Xcode version or iOS SDK.
   - Check the library documentation and GitHub issues for any known issues and potential solutions.

Remember to clean and build your project after each change to see if the issue is resolved. Good luck!
