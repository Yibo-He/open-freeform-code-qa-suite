Yes, you can see the result graphs in Visual Studio Code itself directly by using the built-in Python Interactive Window. This feature allows you to run Python code in a way that's very similar to Jupyter notebooks, but it doesn't require you to install Jupyter.

Here are the steps to do it:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code if you haven't done so already. You can find it in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).

2. Open your Python file.

3. Add `#%%` at the beginning of the code. This will create a cell in the Python Interactive Window.

4. Run the cell by clicking on the `Run Cell` button that appears above the `#%%`.

Here's how your code should look like:

```python
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

After running the cell, the Python Interactive Window will open and display the plot. You can also run the cell by right-clicking in the cell and selecting `Run Current Cell` from the context menu.
