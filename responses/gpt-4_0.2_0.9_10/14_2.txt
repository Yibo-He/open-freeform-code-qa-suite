To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) on a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update your `nuxt.config.js` file to set the `mode` to `'spa'`:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ... other configurations
}
```

2. Build your project for production using the following npm command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the static files for your SPA.

3. Deploy the `dist` folder to your desired public hosting. For GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

   a. Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one.

   b. Move the contents of the `dist` folder to the root of your repository.

   c. Commit and push the changes to the repository.

   d. Go to your repository settings on GitHub, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the branch you pushed the changes to (usually `main` or `master`). Save the changes.

   e. Your Nuxt.js SPA should now be live on GitHub Pages. The URL will be displayed in the GitHub Pages section of your repository settings.

Remember to run `npm run generate` and update your repository every time you make changes to your project.
