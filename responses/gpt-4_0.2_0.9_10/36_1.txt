The error message suggests that you need to include the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency in your `pom.xml`. Since you mentioned that you have already tried adding it but it didn't help, there might be a version conflict or some other issue.

First, make sure you have the correct version of `spring-cloud-dependencies` in your `pom.xml`. For Spring Boot 2.0.8, you should use the `Finchley.SR2` release train. Add or update the following in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <spring-cloud.version>Finchley.SR2</spring-cloud.version>
</properties>

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Next, add the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After adding these dependencies, clean and rebuild your project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

If the issue persists, try adding the following configuration to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
feign.hystrix.enabled=false
```

This will disable Hystrix for Feign clients, which might help in resolving the issue.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project setup, such as the complete `pom.xml` file and any other relevant configuration files.
