This issue might be caused by a missing or incorrect configuration of the Go tools in VSCode. To solve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Go extension for VSCode installed. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab in VSCode and searching for "Go" by the Go Team at Google. Update the extension if necessary.

2. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (View > Terminal) and run the following command to download the Redigo package:

   ```
   go get -u github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

3. Make sure your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables are set correctly. You can check this by running the following commands in the integrated terminal:

   ```
   echo $GOPATH
   echo $GOROOT
   ```

   If they are not set, you can set them by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file (depending on your shell):

   ```
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go
   export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin
   ```

   Replace the paths with the correct ones for your system, and then restart VSCode.

4. In VSCode, open the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and search for "Go Tools Env". Click on "Edit in settings.json" and add the following lines:

   ```
   "go.toolsEnvVars": {
       "GOPATH": "/path/to/your/gopath",
       "GOROOT": "/path/to/your/goroot"
   }
   ```

   Replace the paths with the correct ones for your system.

5. Restart VSCode and check if the error is resolved.

If the issue persists, you can try to reinstall the Go tools by running the following command in the integrated terminal:

```
Go: Install/Update Tools
```

This will open a window with a list of Go tools. Select all the tools and click "OK" to install/update them.
