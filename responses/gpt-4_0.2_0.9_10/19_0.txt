This error occurs when the number of open files exceeds the limit set by your operating system. To resolve this issue, you can try increasing the limit of open files.

For **macOS** and **Linux** users, you can increase the limit by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ulimit -n 4096
```

After running the command, try running `react-native start` again.

For **Windows** users, you can try using the `watchman` package to handle file watching. First, install `watchman` using the instructions provided on their [official website](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

After installing `watchman`, restart your terminal and try running `react-native start` again.

If the issue persists, you can try the following:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file in your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall the dependencies.
3. Run `react-native start` again.

If none of these solutions work, consider creating a new React Native project and copying your source files into the new project.
