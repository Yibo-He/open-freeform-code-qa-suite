I'm sorry to hear that you've lost your work. It can be frustrating when this happens. While I can't guarantee that your work can be recovered, I can suggest a few things you can try:

1. **Check the browser's local storage:** Jupyter Notebook sometimes saves a copy of your work in the browser's local storage. To check this, open the notebook in the same browser you were using when you lost your work and press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette. Type "Recover" and select "Recover from Browser Storage". If there's a saved version in the browser storage, it will be loaded.

2. **Check the terminal output:** If you still have the terminal window open where you ran `jupyter notebook`, you might find some useful information there. Look for any error messages or warnings that could give you more insight into what happened.

3. **Search for temporary files:** Sometimes, Jupyter Notebook creates temporary files while you're working. You can search for these files in your working directory or the directory where Jupyter Notebook is installed. Look for files with a `.ipynb` extension and a name similar to your original notebook. You can open these files in Jupyter Notebook to see if they contain your lost work.

4. **Check the Jupyter Notebook logs:** Jupyter Notebook stores logs in a file called `jupyter.log` located in the `~/.jupyter` directory. Open this file and look for any error messages or warnings related to your lost work.

5. **Use a file recovery tool:** If none of the above methods work, you can try using a file recovery tool like [Disk Drill](https://www.cleverfiles.com/) or [EaseUS Data Recovery](https://www.easeus.com/mac-data-recovery-software/drw-mac-free.htm) to recover deleted or lost files. However, this approach might not be successful if the data has been overwritten.

In the future, to avoid losing work, make sure to save and checkpoint your work frequently. Additionally, consider using a version control system like Git to track changes in your notebooks and back up your work.

I hope one of these methods helps you recover your lost work. Good luck!
