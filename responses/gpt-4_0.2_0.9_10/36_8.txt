It seems like you are missing the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency in your `pom.xml`. Even though you mentioned that you have tried adding it, please make sure you have added it correctly. Here's the dependency you need to add:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Also, make sure you have the correct version of `spring-cloud-dependencies` in your `pom.xml`. Since you are using Spring Boot version 2.0.8, you should use the `Finchley.SR2` version of `spring-cloud-dependencies`. Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>Finchley.SR2</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

After adding these dependencies, clean and rebuild your project:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

If you still face the issue, please share the complete `pom.xml` file and any relevant configuration files for further investigation.
