Yes, you can see the result graphs in Visual Studio Code itself directly by using the built-in Jupyter support. You don't need to install Jupyter notebooks for this. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code from the marketplace.

2. Open your Python file.

3. Convert your Python file into a Python Interactive Window by clicking on the specific icon in the top right corner of the Visual Studio Code window.

4. Run your code. The graph will be displayed in the Python Interactive Window.

Here's your code. No changes are needed:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

Remember to save your file with a `.py` extension and ensure that Visual Studio Code is using the correct Python interpreter (you can select the interpreter in the bottom left corner of the status bar).
