It seems like you have tried most of the common solutions. Here are a few more suggestions you can try:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure your Podfile has the correct target and the required pods are listed under that target. After verifying, run `pod install` again.

2. **Delete Derived Data**: Sometimes, deleting the Derived Data folder can help resolve issues. To do this, go to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations`, click on the arrow next to the Derived Data path, and delete the folder related to your project.

3. **Reset the Simulator**: If you are using a simulator, try resetting it. Go to `Simulator -> Device -> Erase All Content and Settings`.

4. **Recreate the project**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try creating a new project and moving your source files to the new project. This can help if there are any issues with the project settings.

5. **Check your project's Build Settings**: Make sure that the `Framework Search Paths` and `Header Search Paths` are set to `$(inherited)` and recursive.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project setup, such as the version of Xcode, the version of the libraries you are using, and any other relevant details.
