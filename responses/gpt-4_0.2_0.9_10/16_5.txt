To generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen, follow these steps:

1. **Install Swagger Codegen**: First, you need to install Swagger Codegen. You can download it from the [Swagger Codegen GitHub repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). You can either build it from the source or download the pre-built JAR file from the [latest release](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/releases).

2. **Obtain the Swagger/OpenAPI Specification**: To generate a REST client, you need the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file (usually in JSON or YAML format) for your REST server. This file describes the API endpoints, request/response models, and other details. If you don't have the specification file, you can create one using tools like [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or generate it from your server code using libraries like [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) (for .NET) or [Springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox) (for Java).

3. **Generate the REST Client**: Once you have the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, you can generate the REST client using Swagger Codegen. Open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i /path/to/swagger-spec.yaml -l <language> -o /path/to/output/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/swagger-spec.yaml` with the path to your Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, `<language>` with the programming language you want to generate the client in (e.g., `java`, `python`, `csharp`, etc.), and `/path/to/output/directory` with the path to the directory where you want to save the generated client code.

For example, to generate a Python client:

```bash
java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i /path/to/swagger-spec.yaml -l python -o /path/to/output/directory
```

4. **Use the Generated Client**: After the client code is generated, you can import it into your project and use it to interact with the REST server. The generated code usually includes a README file with instructions on how to use the client.

For more information on Swagger Codegen, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen#overview).
