This error usually occurs when the Android Gradle plugin cannot find the keystore file for signing the app. 

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. **Check the path of your keystore file:** Make sure the path to your keystore file in the `signingConfigs` block in your `build.gradle` file is correct. If you're using a relative path, try changing it to an absolute path.

```markdown
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('/absolute/path/to/keystore.jks') // change this to your keystore file
            // rest of the config
        }
    }
    // rest of the file
}
```

2. **Check the keystore file itself:** Make sure the keystore file exists and is accessible. Try to manually navigate to the file in your file system to confirm it's there.

3. **Clean and rebuild the project:** Sometimes, cleaning and rebuilding the project can solve the issue. You can do this by clicking on `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project` in Android Studio.

4. **Invalidate caches and restart:** If none of the above work, try invalidating the caches and restarting Android Studio. You can do this by clicking on `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart`.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about your setup and the exact steps you're taking when you encounter the error.
