It seems like the issue is related to the MongoDB version and platform combination not being available for download. The error message indicates that the requested version-platform combination doesn't exist.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `mongodb-memory-server` package to the latest version, if it's not already up to date. You can do this by running:

   ```
   npm install mongodb-memory-server@latest
   ```

2. Specify a different MongoDB version that is compatible with your platform. You can do this by adding the following configuration to your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "config": {
     "mongodbMemoryServer": {
       "version": "4.2.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `4.2.0` with the desired MongoDB version. Make sure to choose a version that is compatible with your platform.

3. If the issue persists, you can try using a different platform or architecture. You can change the platform and architecture in the `mongodb-memory-server` configuration in your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "config": {
     "mongodbMemoryServer": {
       "platform": "win32",
       "arch": "x64"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `win32` and `x64` with the desired platform and architecture, respectively.

After making these changes, try running your tests again. If the issue still persists, please provide more information about your environment, such as the operating system, Node.js version, and `mongodb-memory-server` version.
