The error you're encountering is likely due to missing dependencies or incorrect installation of Puppeteer. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure you have installed Puppeteer in your project:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

2. If you're running your script on a server or in a Docker container, you might need to install additional dependencies. For example, if you're using a Debian-based system, you can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxi6 libxtst6 libnss3 libcups2 libxss1 libxrandr2 libasound2 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libgtk-3-0
```

3. If you're still encountering issues, you can try running Puppeteer with the `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags. However, be aware that this can pose a security risk, so use it with caution:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
});
```

4. Make sure you have required the `puppeteer` module in your script:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
```

After trying these steps, your code should look like this:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async function() {
  try {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
    });
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.setContent(pdfOutput);
    await page.emulateMedia("screen");
    await page.pdf({
      path: "routes/planiton/pdf/mypdf.pdf",
      format: "A4",
      printBackground: true
    });

    console.log('done');
    await browser.close();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Our Error", e)
  }
})();
```

If you still encounter issues, please provide more information about your environment, such as the operating system and version, Node.js version, and any additional details that might be relevant.
