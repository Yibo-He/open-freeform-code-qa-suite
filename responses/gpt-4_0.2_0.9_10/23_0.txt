The error you're encountering is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. Missing dependencies for Puppeteer.
2. Incorrect installation of Puppeteer.
3. Insufficient permissions for the browser executable.

To resolve this issue, try the following steps:

1. **Install missing dependencies**: If you are using a Linux-based system, you might need to install some additional dependencies for Puppeteer. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxi6 libxext6 libxtst6 libnss3 libcups2 libxss1 libxrandr2 libasound2 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0
   ```

2. **Reinstall Puppeteer**: Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then reinstall your dependencies, including Puppeteer:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set the executable path**: If you still encounter the error, try setting the executable path for Puppeteer manually. You can find the path to the bundled Chromium browser in your `node_modules` folder. It should be something like `node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/<platform-version>/chrome-linux/chrome`. Update your code to set the executable path:

   ```javascript
   const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
     executablePath: '<path-to-chrome-executable>'
   });
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-chrome-executable>` with the actual path to the bundled Chromium browser.

4. **Grant permissions**: If you're still facing issues, ensure that the browser executable has the necessary permissions. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   chmod +x <path-to-chrome-executable>
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-chrome-executable>` with the actual path to the bundled Chromium browser.

After trying these steps, your code should work without any issues. If you still encounter problems, please provide more information about your environment, such as the operating system and Node.js version.
