Yes, you can delete all saved shared preferences in a single shot using the `clear()` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class in Flutter. 

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void deleteAllSavedPreferences() async {
  final SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  prefs.clear();
}
```

In this example, `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` is used to get an instance of `SharedPreferences`. Then, the `clear()` method is called on this instance to delete all the data.

You can call this function when the user taps on logout. 

Please note that this will delete all data, not just specific keys. If you want to delete specific keys, you will have to delete them one by one using the `remove(String key)` method.
