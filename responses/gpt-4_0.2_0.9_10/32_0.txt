The error message indicates that the MongoDB version you're trying to download does not exist for your platform. The MongoDB version being downloaded is `4.0.14` for `win32` and `ia32` architecture.

The MongoDB Memory Server is trying to download MongoDB from the URL `https://fastdl.mongodb.org/win32/mongodb-win32-i386-2008plus-ssl-4.0.14.zip`, which is returning a `403` status code. This means the requested resource is not available.

To fix this issue, you can try the following solutions:

1. **Specify a different MongoDB version**: You can specify a different MongoDB version in your `package.json` file. For example, you can use version `4.2.8` which is a more recent version and likely to be available. Here is how you can do it:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "version": "4.2.8"
  }
}
```

2. **Use a different architecture**: If you're on a 64-bit Windows machine, you can try using the `x64` architecture instead of `ia32`. You can specify this in your `package.json` file as follows:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "arch": "x64"
  }
}
```

3. **Download MongoDB manually**: If the automatic download still doesn't work, you can download MongoDB manually from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community), and then specify the path to the MongoDB binary in your `package.json` file:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "downloadDir": "/path/to/your/mongodb/binary"
  }
}
```

Remember to replace `"/path/to/your/mongodb/binary"` with the actual path to your MongoDB binary.

After making these changes, run `npm install` to install the new configuration, and then try running your tests again.
