To generate a REST client using Swagger Codegen, follow these steps:

1. **Install Swagger Codegen**: First, you need to install Swagger Codegen. You can download the latest version from the [Swagger Codegen GitHub repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). You can also install it using package managers like npm, Homebrew, or Docker. For example, to install using npm, run:

   ```
   npm install -g swagger-codegen
   ```

2. **Obtain the Swagger/OpenAPI specification**: You need the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file (in JSON or YAML format) for your REST server. This file describes the API endpoints, request/response models, and other details. You can either create this file manually or use tools like [Swagger Inspector](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-inspector/) to generate it automatically by inspecting your REST server.

3. **Generate the REST client**: Once you have the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, you can use Swagger Codegen to generate the REST client in your desired programming language. Run the following command:

   ```
   swagger-codegen generate -i <path-to-specification-file> -l <language> -o <output-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-specification-file>` with the path to your Swagger/OpenAPI specification file, `<language>` with the desired programming language (e.g., `java`, `python`, `javascript`, etc.), and `<output-directory>` with the directory where you want to save the generated client code.

   For example, to generate a Python client for a specification file named `swagger.yaml`, run:

   ```
   swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.yaml -l python -o my-python-client
   ```

4. **Use the generated client**: After generating the REST client, you can use it in your application by importing the required modules and classes. The generated client will include instructions on how to use it, usually in a `README.md` file.

That's it! You've successfully generated a REST client using Swagger Codegen.
