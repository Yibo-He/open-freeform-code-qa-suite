It seems that the issue is related to the MongoDB version and platform combination not being available for download. The error message indicates that the requested version-platform combination doesn't exist.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `mongodb-memory-server` package to the latest version:

```bash
npm install --save-dev mongodb-memory-server
```

2. Specify a different MongoDB version in your `package.json` file:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "version": "4.2.0"
  }
}
```

Replace `4.2.0` with the desired MongoDB version that is compatible with your platform.

3. Clear the cache and reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

4. Run the tests again:

```bash
npm run test
```

If the issue persists, you can try using a different MongoDB version or platform combination that is compatible with your system. You can find the available MongoDB versions and platforms on the [MongoDB download center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community).
