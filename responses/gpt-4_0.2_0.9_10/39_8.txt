It seems like you have tried many solutions, but let's try a few more steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure your Podfile includes all the required libraries (AFNetworking, JSONModel, ReactiveCocoa, Realm, SAMKeychain, and Sentry). If any of them are missing, add them and run `pod install` again.

2. **Delete derived data**: Go to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data`, click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder, and delete the entire Derived Data folder. Then, restart Xcode, clean, and build the project.

3. **Check the Framework Search Paths**: Go to your target's Build Settings and search for "Framework Search Paths". Make sure it is set to `$(inherited)` and also includes the correct path to your Pods folder, like `$(PROJECT_DIR)/Pods`. If it's not there, add it.

4. **Reinstall CocoaPods**: Uninstall and reinstall CocoaPods using the following commands:

```
sudo gem uninstall cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

After reinstalling, run `pod install` again and try building the project.

5. **Check your project's .gitignore file**: Ensure that the Pods folder and Podfile.lock file are not being ignored. If they are, remove the corresponding lines from the .gitignore file, commit the changes, and push them to your repository.

If none of these steps work, you may want to consider creating a new project and migrating your code and resources to the new project. This can help eliminate any lingering configuration issues that might be causing the problem.
