I'm sorry to hear that you've lost your work. It can be frustrating, but let's see if we can recover it. The error message you mentioned might be related to a failed POST request, which is used to save the notebook.

Here are a few things you can try to recover your work:

1. **Check the browser's local storage:** Jupyter Notebook stores unsaved changes in the browser's local storage. Open the same browser you were using when working on the notebook, and try the following steps:

   - Open the browser's Developer Tools (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS).
   - Go to the "Application" or "Storage" tab.
   - Look for "Local Storage" in the left sidebar and click on it.
   - You should see a list of keys and values. Look for a key that has your notebook's name in it (e.g., `notebookname.ipynb`).
   - Click on the value corresponding to that key. It should contain your notebook's content in JSON format.
   - Copy the JSON content and save it to a new file with the `.ipynb` extension. Open this file in Jupyter Notebook to see if your work is there.

2. **Check the terminal output:** Sometimes, Jupyter Notebook logs information about unsaved changes in the terminal where it's running. Look for any messages related to saving or autosaving your notebook. It might contain a temporary file path where your changes were saved.

3. **Search for temporary files:** Jupyter Notebook might create temporary files with unsaved changes. Search your computer for files with the `.ipynb` extension, especially in the temporary folders (e.g., `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` on macOS). You can use the `find` command in the terminal to search for these files:

   ```
   find / -iname "*.ipynb" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   This command will search your entire system for `.ipynb` files and display their paths. Look for any files that might be related to your lost work.

If none of these methods work, it's possible that your work might be lost. In the future, make sure to save your work frequently and create backups. Additionally, consider using a version control system like Git to track your changes and prevent data loss.
