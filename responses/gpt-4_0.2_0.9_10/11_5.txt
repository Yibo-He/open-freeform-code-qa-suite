In earlier versions of SQL Server that do not have the `TRIM` function, you can use a combination of `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions to achieve the same result. `LTRIM` removes leading spaces and `RTRIM` removes trailing spaces.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) AS TrimmedString
```

In this code, `LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss))` will first remove any trailing spaces from `@ss` using `RTRIM` and then remove any leading spaces using `LTRIM`. The result is a string with no leading or trailing spaces, which is the same as what `TRIM` would do.
