You can set up path aliases in your `jsconfig.json` file. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@styles/*": ["src/styled/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

In this example, `@styles` is the alias for the `src/styled` directory. The `*` after `@styles/` and `src/styled/` allows you to import any file in the `src/styled` directory.

After setting this up, you should be able to import files from the `src/styled` directory like this:

```javascript
import MyComponent from '@styles/MyComponent';
```

VSCode should be able to provide IntelliSense for these imports. If it doesn't, try restarting VSCode.
