It seems like the issue is related to the MongoDB version and platform combination not being available for download. The error message indicates that the requested version-platform combination doesn't exist (Status Code 403).

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `mongodb-memory-server` package to the latest version by running:

   ```
   npm install mongodb-memory-server@latest --save-dev
   ```

2. Specify a compatible MongoDB version and platform in your project. You can do this by adding the following configuration in your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "config": {
     "mongodbMemoryServer": {
       "version": "4.0.14",
       "platform": "win32",
       "arch": "x64"
     }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace the `version`, `platform`, and `arch` values with the appropriate ones for your system. You can find the available MongoDB versions and platforms [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

3. Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file from your project directory:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

4. Reinstall the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Run the tests again:

   ```
   npm run test
   ```

This should resolve the issue and make `mongodb-memory-server` work as intended.
