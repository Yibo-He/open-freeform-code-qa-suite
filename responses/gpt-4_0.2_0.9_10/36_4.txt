The error message suggests that you need to include the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` dependency in your `pom.xml`. Since you mentioned that you have already tried adding the dependency and it didn't help, I would recommend checking the following:

1. Make sure you have added the correct dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Ensure that you have the correct version of Spring Cloud in your `pom.xml`. Add or update the `spring-cloud-dependencies` in the `dependencyManagement` section:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>Finchley.SR2</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

**Note:** Since you are using Spring Boot 2.0.8, you should use the Finchley release train for Spring Cloud. You can find the compatible versions in the [Spring Cloud Release Train](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview) documentation.

3. Make sure to clean and rebuild your project after making changes to the `pom.xml` file. You can do this using the following Maven commands:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

4. If you still face the issue, try adding the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, clean and rebuild your project again, and then try running your application.
