It seems like the issue is related to the MongoDB version and platform combination not being available for download. The error message `Status Code is 403 (MongoDB's 404)` indicates that the requested version-platform combination does not exist.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `mongodb-memory-server` package to the latest version by running:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev mongodb-memory-server@latest
   ```

2. If you still face the issue, you can try specifying a different MongoDB version in your `package.json` file. Add the following configuration under the `config` key:

   ```json
   "config": {
     "mongodbMemoryServer": {
       "version": "4.2.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `4.2.0` with the desired MongoDB version that is compatible with your platform. You can find the available versions [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community/releases).

3. If the issue persists, you can try using a different platform or architecture. Update the `mongodbMemoryServer` configuration in your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "config": {
     "mongodbMemoryServer": {
       "platform": "win32",
       "arch": "x64",
       "version": "4.2.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `win32`, `x64`, and `4.2.0` with the desired platform, architecture, and MongoDB version, respectively.

After making the changes, run your tests again:

```
npm run test
```

If everything is set up correctly, the tests should run without any issues.
