This error occurs when the Android Gradle plugin attempts to compare two files that don't share the same root directory.

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Clean your project: `Build -> Clean Project`
2. Invalidate caches and restart: `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart`
3. Check your `keystore` path in your `build.gradle` file. Make sure it's correct and the `keystore` file is actually there.
4. If you are using relative path for `keystore`, try using absolute path.

Here is an example of how to set the `keystore` path:

```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('/absolute/path/to/keystore.jks')
            storePassword 'password'
            keyAlias 'keyAlias'
            keyPassword 'password'
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to replace `/absolute/path/to/keystore.jks`, `password`, and `keyAlias` with your actual values.
