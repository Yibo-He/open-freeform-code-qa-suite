It seems like there are two issues in your code. Let's address them one by one.

1. Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle

This error is related to the location package. To fix this, open the `pubspec.yaml` file and make sure you have the correct version of the location package. As of now, the latest version is 4.3.0. So, your `pubspec.yaml` should have the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  location: ^4.3.0
```

After updating the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to download the package.

2. Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'

This error is because you are trying to use a `Future<String>` as a `String` directly. You need to use a `FutureBuilder` to handle the asynchronous nature of the `_getUserLocation()` function.

Update your `NearbyScreen` widget like this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: _getUserLocation(),
      builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
        } else {
          return Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                height: 170,
                width: double.infinity,
                child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
              ),
              Text("hello"),
            ],
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Now, your code should work without any issues. The `FutureBuilder` will handle the asynchronous loading of the image URL and display the image once it's ready.
