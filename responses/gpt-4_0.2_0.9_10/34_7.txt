You can use Angular's `*ngIf` directive to conditionally show or hide the div based on the selected radio button. You need to check if the value of the form control `Schedule` is equal to the ID of the radio button corresponding to "abc". 

Assuming that the ID of the radio button corresponding to "abc" is `abc`, you can modify your div as follows:

```html
<div id='divabc' *ngIf="myform.get('Schedule').value === 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

This will show the div only when the radio button with the value "abc" is selected. 

Please replace `'abc'` with the actual ID of the radio button corresponding to "abc" if it's different.
