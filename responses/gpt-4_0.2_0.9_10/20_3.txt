I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating experience that many of us have been through. 

The error message you saw might have been related to a failed POST request, which is a method used to send data to a server. In the context of Jupyter Notebook, it's used to save your work. If this request fails, your work won't be saved.

Unfortunately, if the notebook was not saved and the checkpoint is blank, there's not much that can be done to recover the work. Jupyter Notebook doesn't have a built-in recovery feature for unsaved changes. 

Here are a few suggestions to prevent this from happening in the future:

1. **Regularly save your work**: You mentioned that you were clicking on `File` > `Save and Checkpoint`. This is a good practice. However, make sure that there are no error messages after you do this.

2. **Check the server logs**: If you're running Jupyter Notebook from a terminal, it will output logs to that terminal. These logs can give you more information about any errors that occur.

3. **Version control**: Consider using a version control system like Git. This allows you to regularly commit changes to your notebooks, providing a history of your work and allowing you to revert to earlier versions if something goes wrong.

4. **Backup your work**: In addition to using version control, you should also regularly backup your work. This could be as simple as copying your notebooks to a separate directory or using a cloud backup service.

5. **Check for autosave extensions**: There are extensions available for Jupyter Notebook that provide additional autosave functionality. One such extension is `autosavetime`. You can install it using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter nbextension install --py autosavetime
jupyter nbextension enable --py autosavetime
```

This extension will automatically save your notebook every few minutes.

Again, I'm sorry for your lost work. I hope these suggestions help prevent this from happening in the future.
