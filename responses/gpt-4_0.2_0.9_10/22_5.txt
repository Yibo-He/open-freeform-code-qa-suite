It looks like you're not destructuring the `booksRefresh` prop in the `AddBookForm` component. You should change the function definition to include curly braces `{}` around `booksRefresh` like this:

```jsx
import React, {useState} from "react";
import {Redirect} from "react-router";
import {addBook} from "../api/api";
import {Button} from "react-bootstrap";

const AddBookForm = ({booksRefresh}) => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const [description, setDescription] = useState();
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const postRequestHandler = () => {
        addBook(title, description);
        booksRefresh();
    }
...
 return (
        ...
            <Button type="submit" onClick={postRequestHandler} variant="outline-success">Add</Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Now, the `booksRefresh` prop should be correctly passed to the child component, and you shouldn't get the "TypeError: booksRefresh is not a function" error.
