I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's always frustrating when something like this happens.

The orange box you mentioned might have been a `POST` error, which usually means that the Jupyter notebook server was unable to save your notebook. This can happen if the server crashes or if there's a network issue (if you're using Jupyter through a network). The `Trusted` message is unrelated to saving; it just means that the notebook is allowed to run JavaScript.

Unfortunately, if the checkpoint file is also blank, then it's unlikely that you can recover your work from Jupyter itself. The checkpoint file is essentially a backup that Jupyter creates every time you save your notebook, so if it's blank, then it means the save operation didn't succeed.

However, there are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the `.ipynb_checkpoints` directory again.** Sometimes, Jupyter creates multiple checkpoint files. If you're lucky, there might be an older checkpoint file that contains your work.

2. **Check your system's temporary files.** When Jupyter fails to save a notebook, it sometimes stores a temporary copy of the notebook in your system's temp directory. The location of this directory varies depending on your operating system, but on MacOS, you can find it by typing `open $TMPDIR` in the terminal.

3. **Use a file recovery tool.** If the above methods don't work, you can try using a file recovery tool to recover the deleted temporary files. This is a bit of a long shot, but it might be worth a try if your work is important. There are many file recovery tools available, both free and paid. Some popular ones include Recuva and Disk Drill.

In the future, to avoid this kind of issue, I would recommend the following:

- **Regularly save your work.** It sounds like you were already doing this, but it's worth repeating. Regularly saving your work is the best way to prevent data loss.

- **Use version control.** Tools like Git can help you keep track of changes to your code and revert back to an earlier version if something goes wrong.

- **Backup your work.** Regularly backing up your work to an external drive or a cloud storage service can help you recover your work if your local copy gets lost or corrupted.

I hope this helps, and I'm sorry I couldn't provide a more positive answer. Losing
