Sure, here is a simple function in JavaScript that converts a local Date object to a UTC Date object:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
    var utcDate = new Date(date.getUTCFullYear(), date.getUTCMonth(), date.getUTCDate(), 
                           date.getUTCHours(), date.getUTCMinutes(), date.getUTCSeconds());
    return utcDate;
}
```

This function creates a new Date object using the UTC year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds of the input date. This will effectively convert the date to UTC. 

Please note that JavaScript Date object is based on a time value that is milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. So, when you create a new Date object, it will be created at the current time in your local timezone, but the underlying time value is still in UTC. The getUTC* methods are used to get the date and time in UTC.
