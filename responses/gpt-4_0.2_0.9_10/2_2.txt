Yes, you can see the result graphs directly in Visual Studio Code using the built-in Python Interactive Window. Here's how you can do it:

1. Make sure you have the Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code. If you don't have it, you can install it from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) by searching for "Python" and clicking the Install button for the extension by Microsoft.

2. Add the following line at the beginning of your code to enable the `%matplotlib inline` magic command:

```python
# %%
```

This will tell the Python Interactive Window to display the plot inline.

Here's the modified code:

```python
# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

3. To run the code in the Python Interactive Window, click the "Run Cell" button that appears above the `# %%` line, or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Enter`.

The plot should now appear directly in the Python Interactive Window within Visual Studio Code.
