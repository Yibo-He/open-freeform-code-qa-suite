It seems like there might be some issues with the environment variables and paths. Please try the following modified code in your notebook's cell:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!conda install -y --prefix /usr/local ujson aiohttp tqdm

import sys
import os

sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/')

import ujson
```

I've made the following changes:

1. Added `chmod +x` to make the script executable.
2. Changed the path in `sys.path.append()` to match the Python version installed by Miniconda (Python 3.7).
3. Removed the lines setting the `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` environment variables, as they are not necessary in this case.

This should allow you to successfully import the `ujson` module.
