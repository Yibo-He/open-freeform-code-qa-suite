Yes, you can see the result graphs directly in Visual Studio Code using the built-in Python Interactive Window. Here's how you can do it:

1. Make sure you have the Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code. If not, you can install it from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) by searching for "Python" and clicking the Install button for the extension by Microsoft.

2. Add a comment `#%%` above the code you want to run in the interactive window. This will create a code cell.

Here's the modified code:

```python
#%%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

3. Click the "Run Cell" button that appears above the `#%%` comment, or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Enter`. This will open the Python Interactive Window in Visual Studio Code and display the graph directly within the editor.

Remember that you don't need to install Jupyter notebooks for this, as the Python Interactive Window is a built-in feature of the Python extension in Visual Studio Code.
