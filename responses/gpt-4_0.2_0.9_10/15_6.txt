Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the completed code:

```python
import io
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image.Image:
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

This code defines the `transform` function that takes a `plt.Figure` as input and returns a `PIL.Image`. It uses an in-memory bytes buffer (`io.BytesIO`) to save the figure as a PNG image, then opens the buffer as a PIL image.
