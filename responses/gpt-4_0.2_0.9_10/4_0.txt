You can use the `random_split` function from PyTorch to split the dataset into training and validation sets. Here's the code to do that:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, random_split

# Split the dataset into training and validation sets
train_size = int(0.8 * len(dataset))
validation_size = len(dataset) - train_size
train_dataset, validation_dataset = random_split(dataset, [train_size, validation_size])

# Create data loaders for training and validation sets
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
validation_loader = DataLoader(validation_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

This code first calculates the sizes of the training and validation sets based on the given ratio (80% for training and 20% for validation). Then, it uses the `random_split` function to split the dataset into two parts. Finally, it creates data loaders for both the training and validation sets with a batch size of 32 and shuffling enabled.
