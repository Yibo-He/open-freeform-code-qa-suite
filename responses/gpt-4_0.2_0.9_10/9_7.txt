In Flutter, the `BottomNavigationBar` widget does not provide a direct way to customize its height. However, you can achieve this by using a workaround. 

One way is to wrap your `BottomNavigationBar` in a `Container` and then set the height of the `Container` to your desired value. 

Here's an example:

```dart
Container(
  height: 60, // Set this to your desired height
  child: BottomNavigationBar(
    items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.home),
        label: 'Home',
      ),
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.business),
        label: 'Business',
      ),
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.school),
        label: 'School',
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

Please note that setting the height too small might cause layout issues, especially if the `BottomNavigationBar` contains text or icons. 

Also, keep in mind that this is a workaround and might not work perfectly in all situations. Flutter's design doesn't encourage changing the height of some widgets like `BottomNavigationBar` because it can lead to UI inconsistencies and issues, especially on different screen sizes and platforms.
