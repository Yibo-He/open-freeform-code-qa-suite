From the `app.module.ts` you provided, it seems like you have imported the `FlexLayoutModule` correctly. However, to use it in your `login-view` component, you also need to import it in the module that declares your `login-view` component.

For example, if your `login-view` component is declared in `AuthModule`, you should import `FlexLayoutModule` in `auth.module.ts` like this:

```typescript
import { FlexLayoutModule } from '@angular/flex-layout';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // your components here
  ],
  imports: [
    // other modules here
    FlexLayoutModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: []
})
export class AuthModule { }
```

After importing `FlexLayoutModule` in the module that declares your `login-view` component, you should be able to use Angular Flex Layout directives (like `fxLayout`, `fxFlex`, etc.) in your `login-view` component's template.

If you have already done this and it's still not working, please provide more details about the issue.
