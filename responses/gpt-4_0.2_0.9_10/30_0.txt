This error is caused by a mismatch in the signing configuration between the old and new versions of Android Studio. To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open your `build.gradle` file (Module: app) in Android Studio.
2. Locate the `signingConfigs` block and ensure that the `storeFile` property is using an absolute path. For example:

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file('/absolute/path/to/your/keystore.jks')
        storePassword 'your_store_password'
        keyAlias 'your_key_alias'
        keyPassword 'your_key_password'
    }
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle files and try generating the signed bundle again.
