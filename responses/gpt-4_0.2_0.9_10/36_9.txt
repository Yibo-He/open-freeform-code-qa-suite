The error message suggests that you are missing the Ribbon dependency in your project. Since you mentioned that you have already tried adding the Ribbon dependency and it didn't help, I suggest you double-check the dependency and also make sure to update the Maven project after adding the dependency.

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After adding the dependency, update your Maven project:

1. In your IDE, right-click on the project.
2. Select "Maven" from the context menu.
3. Click on "Update Project" or "Reimport" (depending on your IDE).

If the issue still persists, try the following:

1. Clean your project by running `mvn clean` in the terminal or command prompt.
2. Rebuild your project by running `mvn install` in the terminal or command prompt.
3. Restart your application.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please share more details about your project setup and configuration, so I can provide further assistance.
