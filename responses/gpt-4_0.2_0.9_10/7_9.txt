You are getting the `IsADirectoryError` because you are trying to copy a file to a directory without specifying the destination filename. You need to extract the filename from the source path and append it to the destination folder path. You can use the `os.path` module to achieve this. Here's the completed function:

```python
import os
from shutil import copyfile

def copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder):
    for item in fileList:
        src = item[0]
        filename = os.path.basename(src)
        dest = os.path.join(destFolder, filename)
        copyfile(src, dest)
```

Now you can call this function with your `fileList` and destination folder:

```python
fileList = [
    ['/home/rob/Pictures/some/folder/picture one something.jpg', '143452'],
    ['/home/rob/Pictures/some/other/folder/pictureBlah.jpg', '473642'],
    ['/home/rob/Pictures/folder/blahblahpicture filename.jpg', '345345']
]

destFolder = "/Users/username/Desktop/testPhotos"

copy_from_file_list(fileList, destFolder)
```

This will copy all the files in `fileList` to the specified `destFolder` while preserving their filenames.
