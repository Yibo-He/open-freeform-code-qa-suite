It seems like the MongoDB version you are trying to download is not available for your platform (win32 and ia32). The error message indicates that the requested version-platform combination does not exist.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `mongodb-memory-server` package to the latest version:

```
npm install mongodb-memory-server@latest --save-dev
```

2. If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, you can try to change the architecture to `x64` in your `package.json` file:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "arch": "x64"
  }
}
```

3. If you still face issues, you can try to use a different version of MongoDB by specifying the version in your `package.json` file:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "version": "4.2.0"
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace "4.2.0" with the desired version of MongoDB that is compatible with your platform.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you can try to download the MongoDB binary manually and set the `MONGOMS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` environment variable to point to the local path of the downloaded binary.

For example, if you have downloaded the MongoDB binary and placed it in the `C:\mongodb-binaries` folder, you can set the environment variable like this:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "downloadMirror": "file:///C:/mongodb-binaries"
  }
}
```

After trying these steps, run the tests again and see if the issue is resolved.
