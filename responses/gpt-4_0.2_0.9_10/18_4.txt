This issue might be caused by a few reasons, such as incorrect Go environment setup, missing dependencies, or issues with the Go extension in VSCode. Here are some steps to help you resolve the issue:

1. **Check your Go environment**:
   Make sure your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables are set correctly. You can check them by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   echo $GOPATH
   echo $GOROOT
   ```

   If they are not set, you can set them in your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file (depending on your shell) like this:

   ```bash
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go
   export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
   ```

   Replace the paths with the correct ones for your system.

2. **Install the Redigo package**:
   Make sure the Redigo package is installed in your `GOPATH`. You can install it by running:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis
   ```

3. **Reload VSCode**:
   Sometimes, the issue might be caused by the Go extension in VSCode. Try reloading the window by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the command palette, then type "Reload Window" and press Enter.

4. **Check your Go extension settings**:
   Make sure the Go extension is using the correct `GOPATH` and `GOROOT`. Open your VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings or `Ctrl+,`), search for "Go:", and check the values for `Go: Gopath` and `Go: Goroot`. Make sure they match the values you set in your environment.

5. **Update your Go tools**:
   It's possible that your Go tools are outdated. You can update them by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the command palette, then type "Go: Install/Update Tools" and press Enter. Select all the tools and click "OK" to update them.

After trying these steps, the issue should be resolved, and you should get IntelliSense suggestions for the Redigo package in VSCode.
