To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. You can do this by setting the `mode` property in your `nuxt.config.js` file to `'spa'`:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your Nuxt.js application for production. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. After building your application, you need to generate a static version of your application. You can do this by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

4. The `generate` command will create a `dist` directory with your compiled application. This `dist` directory is what you will need to deploy to GitHub Pages.

5. To deploy the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages, you can use a package like `gh-pages`. First, install it as a dev-dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

6. Then, add a `deploy` script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

7. Finally, you can deploy your application to GitHub Pages by running the following npm command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, which GitHub Pages will then use to host your application.

Please note that GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so make sure all your file and directory names as well as their references in your code are case-consistently.
