It seems like there are two issues here. Let's address them one by one.

1. Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle

This error is related to the location package. To fix this, open the `settings.gradle` file in the `android` folder of your Flutter project and add the following line inside the `include` block:

```gradle
include ':location_web'
```

2. Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'

This error is caused by trying to use a `Future<String>` as a URL for the `Image.network()` widget. You need to use a `FutureBuilder` to handle the asynchronous nature of the `_getUserLocation()` function. Update your `NearbyScreen` class as follows:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height: 170,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (ctx, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
              }
              if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Center(child: Text('An error occurred!'));
              }
              return Image.network(snapshot.data);
            },
          ),
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This will display a `CircularProgressIndicator` while the map URL is being fetched and then display the image once the URL is available. If there's an error, it will display an error message.
