Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the corrected code:

```python
!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
!conda install -q -y --prefix /usr/local ujson
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/')
import ujson
```

Here are the changes I made:

1. I added the `chmod +x` command to make the downloaded script executable.
2. I changed the path to the script in the `bash` command to `./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` to ensure it's being run from the current directory.
3. I removed the unnecessary `rm` command. It's not needed because the script is run with the `-b` (batch) option, which automatically deletes it after installation.
4. I removed the unnecessary `os.environ` commands. They're not needed because the `conda install` command already installs the packages in the correct location.
5. I changed the Python version in the `sys.path.append` command to `3.7` because that's the version that Miniconda3 installs by default. You were appending the path for Python 3.6, which is why the `import ujson` command was failing.

Please try this corrected code and let me know if it works for you.
