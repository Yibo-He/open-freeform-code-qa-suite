The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the Flutter plugin system. It seems like the `location` package is trying to use the `location_web` package, which is not found. 

To fix this, you can try to add the `location_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  location_web: ^1.0.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

The second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'` is because you are trying to use a `Future<String>` as a `String`. The `Image.network` function expects a `String` as the URL, but you are passing a `Future<String>`.

You can use a `FutureBuilder` to handle this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          height:170, 
          width: double.infinity,
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getUserLocation(),
            builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else {
                if (snapshot.hasError)
                  return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
                else
                  return Image.network(snapshot.data);  // snapshot.data  <-- here
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, `FutureBuilder` will handle the `Future` and rebuild the widget when the future completes. If the future is still loading, it will show a loading spinner. If the future has completed, it will show the image. If there was an error, it will show the error message.
