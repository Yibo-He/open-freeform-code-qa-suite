I'm sorry to hear about your lost work. It's a frustrating experience that many of us have been through. 

The error message you mentioned could be related to a failed POST request, which is a method used to send data to a server. In the context of Jupyter Notebook, it might be related to the notebook's attempt to autosave your work.

Unfortunately, if the `.ipynb_checkpoints` file is blank, it's likely that your work was not saved. Jupyter Notebook uses these checkpoint files to store a snapshot of your notebook, and if it's blank, it means no snapshot was saved.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the notebook's metadata**: Jupyter Notebook stores some metadata about the notebook in a JSON format. You can access this by clicking on `Edit` > `Edit Notebook Metadata` in the Jupyter Notebook menu. It's a long shot, but there might be some useful information there.

2. **Check your browser's local storage**: Jupyter Notebook uses your browser's local storage to save your work in between autosaves. If your browser hasn't been closed or cleared its local storage, you might be able to recover some of your work. In Chrome, you can check this by opening the Developer Tools (`View` > `Developer` > `Developer Tools`), then going to the `Application` tab, and looking under `Local Storage` in the left sidebar.

3. **Use a file recovery tool**: If the notebook file was deleted, you might be able to recover it using a file recovery tool. There are many available, both free and paid. However, this is a bit of a long shot and should be used as a last resort.

In the future, to avoid losing work, I would recommend:

- Regularly pushing your notebooks to a version control system like Git.
- Setting up Jupyter Notebook to autosave more frequently. You can do this by adding the following line to your `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file: `c.NotebookApp.autosave_interval = 60  # autosave every minute`
- Always making sure your notebook is connected to the Jupyter server. The "Trusted" message you saw is related to whether the notebook's output is trusted, not whether it's connected to the server.

I hope this helps, and I'm sorry I couldn't provide a more definitive solution.
