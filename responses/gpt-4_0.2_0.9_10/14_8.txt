To deploy your Nuxt.js static website as a single page application (SPA) to a public hosting like GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set your Nuxt.js application to SPA mode. Open your `nuxt.config.js` file and set the mode to `spa`:

```javascript
export default {
  mode: 'spa',
  // ...
}
```

2. Then, you need to build your application for production. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `dist` directory with everything you need to deploy.

3. After building your application, you need to deploy the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages. If you're using `gh-pages` npm package, you can do it by running:

```bash
npx gh-pages -d dist
```

If you haven't installed `gh-pages`, you can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

4. Finally, you need to configure your repository to use the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

Please note that GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository, and it might not be the best choice for all kinds of applications. If you're building a larger application, you might want to consider other hosting options like Vercel or Netlify that are more suited for hosting larger SPAs.
