Sure, here is a simple function in JavaScript that gets the current date and formats it as `MM/DD/YYYY`.

```javascript
function getCurrentDate() {
    var date = new Date();
    var day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
    var month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); //January is 0!
    var year = date.getFullYear();

    return month + '/' + day + '/' + year;
}
```

This function uses the `Date` object to get the current date. The `getDate`, `getMonth`, and `getFullYear` methods are used to get the day, month, and year respectively. The `padStart` method is used to ensure that the day and month are always two digits long. The `getMonth` method returns a zero-based value (where 0 indicates the first month), so 1 is added to get the correct month. The values are then concatenated into a string in the `MM/DD/YYYY` format.
