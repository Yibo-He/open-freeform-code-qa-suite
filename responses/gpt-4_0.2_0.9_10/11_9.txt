Since you are using an early version of SQL Server that does not have the TRIM function, you can use a combination of LTRIM and RTRIM functions to achieve the same result. Here's the modified code:

```sql
DECLARE @ss varchar(60)
SET @ss = ' admin '

SELECT LTRIM(RTRIM(@ss)) AS TrimmedString
```

This code will first remove the trailing spaces using RTRIM and then remove the leading spaces using LTRIM, effectively trimming the spaces from both ends of the string.
