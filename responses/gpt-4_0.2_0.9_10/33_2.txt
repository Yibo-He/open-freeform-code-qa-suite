The error `Plugin project :location_web not found. Please update settings.gradle;` is related to the Flutter project configuration. It seems like the Flutter project is trying to use the `location_web` plugin, but it can't find it. 

You can try the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. Open the `settings.gradle` file in the android directory of your Flutter project.
2. Add the following lines:

```gradle
include ':location_web'
project(':location_web').projectDir = new File('../flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/location_web-0.0.1+2/android')
```

Replace `0.0.1+2` with the version of `location_web` you are using.

As for the second error `Invalid argument(s): No host specified in URI file:///Instance%20of%20'Future%3CString%3E'`, it's because you're trying to use a `Future<String>` as a `String` directly. 

In Flutter, you can't directly use the value of a `Future` because it's not available at the time of the execution of the code. You need to wait for the `Future` to complete. You can use a `FutureBuilder` for this:

```dart
class NearbyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        FutureBuilder(
          future: _getUserLocation(),
          builder: (ctx, snapshot) {
            // Show a loading spinner while waiting for the future to complete
            if (!snapshot.hasData) {
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            }
            return Container(
              height: 170,
              width: double.infinity,
              child: Image.network(snapshot.data),
            );
          },
        ),
        Text("hello"),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, `FutureBuilder` will take care of waiting for the `Future` to complete and then build the widget with the data. If the `Future` is not complete, it will show a loading spinner.
