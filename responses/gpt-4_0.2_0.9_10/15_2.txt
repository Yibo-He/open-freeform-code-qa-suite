You can achieve this by using `io.BytesIO` to create an in-memory buffer and save the figure to that buffer. Then, you can open the buffer as a `PIL.Image`. Here's the complete code:

```python
import io
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def transform(input: plt.Figure) -> Image.Image:
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    input.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    img = Image.open(buf)
    return img
```

This function takes a `plt.Figure` as input and returns a `PIL.Image`. The figure is saved to an in-memory buffer in PNG format, and then the buffer is opened as a `PIL.Image`.
