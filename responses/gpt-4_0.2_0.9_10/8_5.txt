Sure, here is a simple function in JavaScript that converts a local Date object to a UTC Date object:

```javascript
function convertToUTC(date) {
    var utcDate = new Date(date.getUTCFullYear(), date.getUTCMonth(), date.getUTCDate(), 
                           date.getUTCHours(), date.getUTCMinutes(), date.getUTCSeconds());
    return utcDate;
}
```

This function takes a Date object as an argument and creates a new Date object using the UTC year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds of the original date. The new Date object is then returned.

Please note that JavaScript Date object is based on the UTC time by default, but when you display a date, it is typically converted to the local time. This function will give you a date object that, when displayed, will show the UTC time instead of the local time.
