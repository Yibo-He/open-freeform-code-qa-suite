The error message you're seeing is due to the linker (`ld`) not being able to find the libraries it needs to link your application. The libraries are specified with the `-L` option, and the paths provided do not exist on your system.

Here are a few more things you could try:

1. **Check your Library Search Paths**: Go to your project settings and check the "Library Search Paths" under "Build Settings". Make sure the paths listed there are correct and the libraries exist at those locations.

2. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure your Podfile includes all the libraries that your project needs and that they are the correct version. After modifying your Podfile, run `pod install` again.

3. **Check your project's .pch file**: If your project has a .pch file, make sure it's correctly importing the libraries.

4. **Reinstall the libraries**: If the libraries are installed manually, try reinstalling them. If they are installed using a package manager like Cocoapods, try uninstalling and reinstalling the package manager itself, then reinstall the libraries.

5. **Create a new project**: As a last resort, you could try creating a new project and moving your code over. This can help if the problem is due to a corrupted project file.

Remember to clean and build your project after each step to make sure any changes are applied.
