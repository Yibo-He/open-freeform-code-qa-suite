This error is likely caused by a misconfiguration in your signing configuration or a problem with the Android Gradle Plugin. To resolve this issue, try the following steps:

1. Clean and rebuild your project:
   - Go to `Build` > `Clean Project`
   - Then, go to `Build` > `Rebuild Project`

2. Update your Android Gradle Plugin to the latest version in your project-level `build.gradle` file:
   ```
   dependencies {
       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.2'
   }
   ```

3. Update your Gradle Wrapper to the latest version in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:
   ```
   distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
   ```

4. Make sure your signing configuration in the app-level `build.gradle` file is correct:
   ```
   android {
       signingConfigs {
           release {
               storeFile file("your_keystore_path")
               storePassword "your_keystore_password"
               keyAlias "your_key_alias"
               keyPassword "your_key_password"
           }
       }
       buildTypes {
           release {
               signingConfig signingConfigs.release
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. Sync your project with Gradle files:
   - Go to `File` > `Sync Project with Gradle Files`

6. If the issue persists, try invalidating caches and restarting Android Studio:
   - Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart...` > `Invalidate and Restart`

After completing these steps, try generating the signed bundle again.
