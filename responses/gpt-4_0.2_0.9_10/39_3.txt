The error message you're seeing is related to the linker not being able to find the libraries specified in the `-L` options. This could be due to a number of reasons, but given the steps you've already tried, it seems like the issue might be related to your project's configuration or the specific libraries you're using.

Here are some additional steps you can try:

1. **Check the Library Search Paths**: Go to your project's Build Settings and look for "Library Search Paths". Make sure that the paths listed there actually exist and contain the libraries you're trying to link against. If the paths are incorrect, you'll need to update them to point to the correct locations.

2. **Check the Libraries Themselves**: It's possible that the libraries you're trying to link against aren't compatible with your project for some reason. You can try removing them one by one to see if the problem persists. If the problem goes away after removing a specific library, that library is likely the cause of the issue.

3. **Reinstall the Libraries**: If the libraries are being managed by CocoaPods, you can try reinstalling them. Delete your `Podfile.lock` file and the `Pods/` directory, then run `pod install` again.

4. **Check Your Project's Build Architecture**: Make sure that your project's build architecture matches the architecture of the libraries you're trying to link against. You can check this in your project's Build Settings under "Architectures".

5. **Create a New Project**: If all else fails, you can try creating a new project and adding the libraries one by one to see if the problem persists. This can help you isolate the issue and determine whether it's related to your project's configuration or the libraries themselves.

Remember to clean and build your project after each change to ensure that you're working with the most recent build.
