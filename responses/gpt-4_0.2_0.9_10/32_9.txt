It seems like the issue is related to the MongoDB version and platform combination not being available for download. The error message indicates that the requested version-platform combination doesn't exist:

```
Error: Status Code is 403 (MongoDB's 404)
This means that the requested version-platform combination dosnt exist
```

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `mongodb-memory-server` package to the latest version:

```bash
npm install --save-dev mongodb-memory-server@latest
```

2. Specify a different MongoDB version in your `package.json` file:

```json
"config": {
  "mongodbMemoryServer": {
    "version": "4.2.0"
  }
}
```

Replace `4.2.0` with the desired MongoDB version that is compatible with your platform. You can check the available versions and platforms on the [MongoDB download page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

3. Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

4. Reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Run the tests again:

```bash
npm run test
```

If the issue persists, try using a different MongoDB version or platform in the `package.json` configuration.
