You can use Angular's structural directive `*ngIf` to conditionally show or hide the div based on the selected value of the radio group. Here is how you can modify your div:

```html
<div id='divabc' *ngIf="myform.get('Schedule').value === 'abc'">ABC</div>
```

This will show the div with id 'divabc' only when the selected value of the radio group in the form 'myform' is 'abc'. 

Please note that 'abc' should be the value of the radio button, not the display text. If 'abc' is the display text and the value is different, you should compare with the value instead. 

Also, make sure that you have initialized the form control 'Schedule' in your component.
